      "abstract": "Small signal analysis is a special case of analytical approaches using Taylor expansions of power system differential equations with the truncation performed at order one. The truncated Taylor expansions (TTEs) at higher orders can lead to better approaches for stability analysis by considering higher order nonlinearities, e.g. normal form, modal series and nonlinear modal decoupling. This paper presents fundamental studies on how accurate transient stability analysis results can be obtained from the TTE systems compared to that on the original system. The analytical investigation is conducted on single-machine-infinite-bus power systems. Conclusions are drawn from there and verified on two multi-machine power systems by extensive numerical simulations.",

The main advantages of the proposed method are that the architecture provides online coherency grouping that properly characterizes real-time changes in the power grid and online wide-area signal selection based on residue method for proper selection of the WAC signals. The proposed architecture can, thus, accurately monitors changes in the power grid and select the appropriate control signal for more effectively damping the interarea oscillation when compared to the conventional local signal based power system stabilizers or offline based WAC designs. The architecture is tested on a wind integrated two-area system and the IEEE 39 bus system in order to show the capability of the proposed method.",

However, the weather is continuously changing, and this causes a discontinuity of energy generation. PV Power forecasting is a suitable solution to handle sudden disjointedness on energy generation by providing fast dispatching to grid electricity. These methods present a key insight into matchmaking grid electricity and photovoltaic plants. Bootstrap aggregation Ensemble method(Bagging) is classified as one of the most useful machine learning models which are applicable to supervised learning regression tasks. Following this regard, this paper proposes a state-of-art method based on bagging and this method works perfectly for PV power forecasting. The latter had powerful capabilities of tracking the behavior of stochastic problems with good accuracy with the aid of feature importance information. This approach comes to optimize bias/variance using feature weighting vector. Thus, this paper is devoted to present various feature importance techniques for Photovoltaic forecasting parameters. This technique consists of improving the aforementioned ensemble model via contributing the knowledge expertise obtained from features analysis to be directly transformed into the Ensemble model. The proposed model is tested on PV power prediction. Therefore, the benchmarked technique shows an improvement in accuracy in terms of RMSE to 5%.",

      "abstract": "Solar energy is one of the most economical and clean sustainable energy sources on the planet. However, the solar energy throughput is highly unpredictable due to its dependency on a plethora of conditions including weather, seasons, and other ecological/environmental conditions. Thus, the solar energy prediction is an inevitable necessity to optimize solar energy and also to improve the efficiency of solar energy systems. Conventionally, the optimization of the solar energy is undertaken by subject matter experts using their domain knowledge; although it is impractical for even the experts to tune the solar systems on a continuous basis. We strongly believe that the power of machine learning can be harnessed to better optimize the solar energy production by learning the correlation between various conditions and solar energy production from historical data which is typically readily available. For this use, this paper predicts the daily total energy generation of an installed solar program using the Naive Bayes classifier. In the forecast procedure, one year historical dataset including daily moderate temperatures, daily total sunshine duration, daily total global solar radiation and daily total photovoltaic energy generation parameters are used as the categorical valued features. By way of this Naive Bayes program the sensitivity and the precision measures are improved for the photovoltaic energy prediction and also the consequences of other solar characteristics on the solar energy production have been assessed.",

      "abstract": "In the raise of many global organizations deploying their data centers and content services in India, the prefix reachability performance study from global destinations garners our attention. The events such as failures and attacks occurring in the Internet topology have impact on Autonomous System (AS) paths announced in the control plane and reachability of prefixes from spatially distributed ASes. As a consequence the customer reachability to the services in terms of increased latency and outages for a short or long time are experienced. The challenge in control plane event detection is when the data plane traffic is able to reach the intended destinations correctly. However detection of such events are crucial for the operations of content and data center industries. By monitoring the spatially distributed routing table features like AS path length distributions, spatial prefix reachability distribution and covering to overlap route ratio, we can detect the control plane events. In our work, we study prefix AS paths from the publicly available route-view data and analyze the global reachability as well as reachability to Indian AS topology. To capture the spatial events in a single temporal pattern, we propose a counting based measure using prefixes announced by x % of spatial peers. Employing statistical characteristics change point detection and temporal aberration algorithm on the time series of the proposed measure, we identify the occurrence of long and stochastic control plane events. The impact and duration of the events are also quantified. We validate the mechanisms over the proposed measure using the SEA-Me-We4 cable cut event manifestations in the control plane of Indian AS topology. The cable cut events occurred on 6th June 2012 (long term event) and 17th April 2012 (stochastic event) are considered for validation.",

This data covers a 5-year period with statistics for 2.7 million hosts. The resource model is based on statistical analysis of host computational power, memory, and storage as well as how these resources change over time and the correlations between them. We find that resources with few discrete values (core count, memory) are well modeled by exponential laws governing the change of relative resource quantities over time. Resources with a continuous range of values are well modeled with either correlated normal distributions (processor speed for integer operations and floating point operations) or log-normal distributions (available disk space). We validate and show the utility of the models by applying them to a resource allocation problem for Internet-distributed applications, and demonstrate their value over other models.

Since the radio is the main cause of power consumption in a sensor node, transmission/reception of data should be limited as much as possible. To this aim, we propose a novel distributed approach to data aggregation based on fuzzy numbers and weighted average operators to reduce data communication in WSNs when we are interested in the estimation of an aggregated value such as maximum or minimum temperature measured in the network. The basic point of our approach is that each node maintains an estimate of the aggregated value. Based on this estimate, the node decides whether a new value measured by the sensor on board the node or received through a message has to be propagated along the network. We show how the lifetime of the network can be estimated through the datasheet of the sensor node and the number of received and transmitted messages. We discuss and evaluate the application of our approach to the monitoring of the maximum temperature in a 100-node simulated WSN and a 12-node real WSN. Finally, we compute the estimates of the lifetimes for both the networks.",

From the existing work done so far, we can examine that there is no combined solution of multi-channel assignment with routing and congestion control. In this paper, we propose a congestion control routing protocol along with multi-channel assignment. We use a traffic aware metric in this protocol in order to provide quality of service. The proposed protocol can improve the throughput and channel utilization to very high extent because it provides solution for multi-channel assignment and congestion control. The proposed algorithm assigns the channels in a way that, congestion is avoided and co-channel interference levels among links with same channel are reduced. By our simulation results in NS2, we show that the proposed protocol attains high throughput and channel utilization along with reduced latency.",

In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that combines both approaches through a model of semantic attention. Our algorithm learns to selectively attend to semantic concept proposals and fuse them into hidden states and outputs of recurrent neural networks.

      "abstract": "This paper develops the FastRNN and FastGRNN algorithms to address the twin RNN limitations of inaccurate training and inefficient prediction. Previous approaches have improved accuracy at the expense of prediction costs making them infeasible for resource-constrained and real-time applications. Unitary RNNs have increased accuracy somewhat by restricting the range of the state transition matrix's singular values but have also increased the model size as they require a larger number of hidden units to make up for the loss in expressive power. Gated RNNs have obtained state-of-the-art accuracies by adding extra parameters thereby resulting in even larger models. FastRNN addresses these limitations by adding a residual connection that does not constrain the range of the singular values explicitly and has only two extra scalar parameters. FastGRNN then extends the residual connection to a gate by reusing the RNN matrices to match state-of-the-art gated RNN accuracies but with a 2-4x smaller model. Enforcing FastGRNN's matrices to be low-rank, sparse and quantized resulted in accurate models that could be up to 35x smaller than leading gated and unitary RNNs. This allowed FastGRNN to accurately recognize the \"Hey Cortana\" wakeword with a 1 KB model and to be deployed on severely resource-constrained IoT microcontrollers too tiny to store other RNN models. FastGRNN's code is available at this https URL.",

Inter-session network coding and opportunistic routing can leverage the broadcast nature of the wireless channel to improve the performance for CRNs. In this paper we present a coding aware opportunistic routing protocol for multi-channel CRNs, cognitive radio opportunistic routing (CROR) protocol, which jointly considers the probability of successful spectrum utilization, packet loss rate, and coding opportunities.

      "abstract": "Wireless networks are built upon a shared medium that makes it easy for adversaries to launch jamming-style attacks. These attacks can be easily accomplished by an adversary emitting radio frequency signals that do not follow an underlying MAC protocol. Jamming attacks can severely interfere with the normal operation of wireless networks and, consequently, mechanisms are needed that can cope with jamming attacks. In this paper, we examine radio interference attacks from both sides of the issue: first, we study the problem of conducting radio interference attacks on wireless networks, and second we examine the critical issue of diagnosing the presence of jamming attacks. Specifically, we propose four different jamming attack models that can be used by an adversary to disable the operation of a wireless network, and evaluate their effectiveness in terms of how each method affects the ability of a wireless node to send and receive packets. We then discuss different measurements that serve as the basis for detecting a jamming attack, and explore scenarios where each measurement by itself is not enough to reliably classify the presence of a jamming attack. In particular, we observe that signal strength and carrier sensing time are unable to conclusively detect the presence of a jammer. Further, we observe that although by using packet delivery ratio we may differentiate between congested and jammed scenarios, we are nonetheless unable to conclude whether poor link utility is due to jamming or the mobility of nodes. The fact that no single measurement is sufficient for reliably classifying the presence of a jammer is an important observation, and necessitates the development of enhanced detection schemes that can remove ambiguity when detecting a jammer. To address this need, we propose two enhanced detection protocols that employ consistency checking. The first scheme employs signal strength measurements as a reactive consistency check for poor packet delivery ratios, while the second scheme employs location information to serve as the consistency check. Throughout our discussions, we examine the feasibility and effectiveness of jamming attacks and detection schemes using the MICA2 Mote platform.",

When ID and EH users are simultaneously served by joint beamforming vectors, the harvested energy can be increased at the cost of an SINR loss for ID users. To characterize the SINR loss, the target SINR ratio \u03bc is introduced as the target SINR (i.e., SINR constraint) normalized by the received SINR achievable with ZFBF. Based on that ratio, the sum rate and harvested energy obtained from the proposed algorithm are analyzed under perfect/imperfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT).

      "abstract": "Image-space simplifications have been used to accelerate the calculation of computer graphic images since the dawn of visual simulation. Texture mapping has been used to provide a means by which images may themselves be used as display primitives. The work reported by this paper endeavors to carry this concept to its logical extreme by using interpolated images to portray three-dimensional scenes. The special-effects technique of morphing, which combines interpolation of texture maps and their shape, is applied to computing arbitrary intermediate frames from an array of prestored images. If the images are a structured set of views of a 3D object or scene, intermediate frames derived by morphing can be used to approximate intermediate 3D transformations of the object or scene. Using the view interpolation approach to synthesize 3D scenes has two main advantages. First, the 3D representation of the scene may be replaced with images. Second, the image synthesis time is independent of the scene complexity. The correspondence between images, required for the morphing method, can be predetermined automatically using the range data associated with the images. The method is further accelerated by a quadtree decomposition and a view-independent visible priority. Our experiments have shown that the morphing can be performed at interactive rates on today\u2019s high-end personal computers. Potential applications of the method include virtual holograms, a walkthrough in a virtual environment, image-based primitives and incremental rendering. The method also can be used to greatly accelerate the computation of motion blur and soft shadows cast by area light sources.

      "abstract": "Depth-image-based rendering (DIBR) oriented view synthesis has been widely employed in the current depth-based 3-D video systems by synthesizing a virtual view from an arbitrary viewpoint. However, holes may appear in the synthesized view due to disocclusion, thus significantly degrading the quality. Consequently, efforts have been made on developing effective and efficient hole-filling algorithms. Current hole-filling techniques generally extrapolate/interpolate the hole regions with the neighboring information based on an assumption that the texture pattern in the holes is similar to that of the neighboring background information. However, in many scenarios, especially of complex texture, the assumption may not hold. In other words, hole-filling techniques can only provide an estimation for a hole which may not be good enough or may even be erroneous considering a wide variety of complex scene of images. In this paper, we first examine the view interpolation with multiple reference views, demonstrating that the problem of emerging holes in a target virtual view can be greatly alleviated by making good use of other neighboring complementary views in addition to its two (commonly used) most neighboring primary views. The effects of using multiple views for view extrapolation in reducing holes are also investigated in this paper. In view of the 3D Video and ongoing free-viewpoint TV standardization, we propose a new view synthesis framework, which employs multiple views to synthesize output virtual views. Furthermore, a scheme of selective warping of complementary views is developed by efficiently locating a small number of useful pixels in the complementary views for hole reduction, to avoid full warping of additional complementary views thus lowering greatly the warping complexity. Experimental results show that the hole size based on two primary reference views may be reduced by up to about 70% with the help of two complementary reference views in the case of view interpolation, while the hole size based on one primary reference view may be reduced by about 27% with the help of one more complementary reference view in view extrapolation. Moreover, it is shown that by using one more pair of views in view interpolation and one more view in view extrapolation, 10% hole pixels may be reduced additionally.",

      "abstract": "Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a revolutionary and transformative technology for achieving spectrum and energy efficient wireless communication cost-effectively in the future. Specifically, an IRS consists of a large number of low-cost passive elements each being able to reflect the incident signal independently with an adjustable phase shift so as to collaboratively achieve three-dimensional (3D) passive beamforming without the need of any transmit radio-frequency (RF) chains. In this paper, we study an IRS-aided single-cell wireless system where one IRS is deployed to assist in the communications between a multi-antenna access point (AP) and multiple single-antenna users. We formulate and solve new problems to minimize the total transmit power at the AP by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming by active antenna array at the AP and reflect beamforming by passive phase shifters at the IRS, subject to users\u2019 individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints. Moreover, we analyze the asymptotic performance of IRS\u2019s passive beamforming with infinitely large number of reflecting elements and compare it to that of the traditional active beamforming/relaying. Simulation results demonstrate that an IRS-aided MIMO system can achieve the same rate performance as a benchmark massive MIMO system without using IRS, but with significantly reduced active antennas/RF chains. We also draw useful insights into optimally deploying IRS in future wireless systems.",

      "abstract": "Thanks to the strong ability against the inter-cell interference, cell-free network is considered as a promising technique to improve network capacity. However, further capacity improvement requires to deploy more base stations (BSs) with high cost and power consumption. To address this issue, inspired by the recently developed reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technique, we propose the concept of RIS-aided cell-free network to improve the capacity with low cost and power consumption. The key idea is to replace some of the required BSs by low-cost and energy-efficient RISs. Then, in a wideband RIS-aided cell-free network, we formulate the problem of joint precoding design at BSs and RISs to maximize the network capacity. Due to the non-convexity and high complexity of the formulated problem, we develop an alternating optimization framework to solve this challenging problem. In particular, we decouple this problem via fractional programming, and solve the subproblems alternatively. Note that most of the scenarios considered in existing works are special cases of the general scenario studied in this paper, and the proposed joint precoding framework can serve as a general solution to maximize the capacity in most existing RIS-aided scenarios. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that, compared with the conventional cell-free network, the network capacity under the proposed scheme can be improved significantly.",

We also argue that such mechanisms offer the means to match closely the energy demand to the energy supply in order to unlock the possibility for energy-neutral WSNs that leverage EH capability.

Then, we use the detected physical activity, the time and the user's speed to infer his daily activity (watching TV, going to the bathroom,\u2026) through the use of a reinforcement learning environment, the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process framework. Once the daily activities are recognized, we translate this information into energy expenditure using the compendium of physical activities. By successfully detecting 8 physical activities at 90%, we reached an overall accuracy of 80% in recognizing 17 different daily activities. This result leads us to estimate the energy expenditure of the user with a mean error of 26% of the expected estimation.",

An observer is firstly developed to estimate the tracking error vector directly, and the stability of the observer is analyzed based on Meyer-Kalman-Yakubovich (MKY) lemma. Based on the observer, the equivalent control law is approximated by a double-input single-output fuzzy logic system (FLS), in which the observation of the sliding surface and its derivative are applied as the inputs. In addition, an adaptive switching control law is added to mitigate the system chattering and improve the stability of the system. The free parameters of the controller are adjusted online by the adaptive laws that are derived from the Lyapunov stability analysis. Finally, the convergence of the overall closed-loop system is demonstrated, and the simulation examples illustrate the efficacy of the proposed control method.",

Specifically, an IRS consists of a large number of low-cost passive elements each being able to reflect the incident signal independently with an adjustable phase shift so as to collaboratively achieve three-dimensional (3D) passive beamforming without the need of any transmit radio-frequency (RF) chains. In this paper, we study an IRS-aided single-cell wireless system where one IRS is deployed to assist in the communications between a multi-antenna access point (AP) and multiple single-antenna users. We formulate and solve new problems to minimize the total transmit power at the AP by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming by active antenna array at the AP and reflect beamforming by passive phase shifters at the IRS, subject to users\u2019 individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints. Moreover, we analyze the asymptotic performance of IRS\u2019s passive beamforming with infinitely large number of reflecting elements and compare it to that of the traditional active beamforming/relaying. Simulation results demonstrate that an IRS-aided MIMO system can achieve the same rate performance as a benchmark massive MIMO system without using IRS, but with significantly reduced active antennas/RF chains.

Given a demand of content request rates and paths followed, we wish to determine the content placement that maximizes the expected caching gain, i.e., the reduction of routing costs due to intermediate caching. The offline version of this problem is NP-hard and, in general, the demand and topology may be a priori unknown. Hence, a distributed, adaptive approximation algorithm for placing contents into caches is desired. We show that path replication, a simple algorithm frequently encountered in literature, can be arbitrarily suboptimal when combined with traditional eviction policies. We propose a distributed, adaptive algorithm that performs stochastic gradient ascent on a concave relaxation of the expected caching gain, and constructs a probabilistic content placement within a  $1-1/e$  factor from the optimal, in expectation. Motivated by our analysis, we also propose a novel greedy eviction policy to be used with path replication, and show through numerical evaluations that both algorithms significantly outperform path replication with traditional eviction policies over a broad array of network topologies.",

However, previous pipelining schemes result in unbalanced memory allocation over the pipeline stages. This has been identified as a major challenge for scalable pipelined solutions. This paper proposes a flexible bidirectional linear pipeline architecture based on widely-used dual-port SRAMs. A search tree is partitioned, and then mapped onto pipeline stages by a bidirectional fine-grained mapping scheme. We introduce the notion of inversion factor and several heuristics to invert subtrees for memory balancing. Due to its linear structure, the architecture maintains packet input order, and supports non-blocking route updates. Our experiments show that, the architecture can achieve a perfectly balanced memory distribution over the pipeline stages, for both trie-based IP lookup and tree-based multi-dimensional packet classification. For IP lookup, it can store a full backbone routing table with 154419 entries using 2MB of memory, and sustain a high throughput of 1.87 billion packets per second (GPPS), i.e. 0.6 Tbps for the minimum size (40 bytes) packets. The throughput can be improved further to be 2.4 Tbps, by employing caching to exploit the Internet traffic locality.",

      "abstract": "In a practical massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) system, the number of antennas at a base station (BS) is constrained by the space and cost factors, which limits the throughput gain promised by theoretical analysis. This paper thus studies the feasibility of adopting the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) to further improve the beamforming gain of the uplink communications in a massive MIMO system. Under such a novel system, the central question lies in whether the IRS is able to enhance the network throughput as expected, if the channel estimation overhead is taken into account. In this paper, we first show that the favorable propagation property for the conventional massive MIMO system without IRS, i.e., the channels of arbitrary two users are orthogonal, no longer holds for the IRS-assisted massive MIMO system, due to its special channel property that each IRS element reflects the signals from all the users to the BS via the same channel. As a result, the maximal-ratio combining (MRC) receive beamforming strategy leads to strong inter-user interference and thus even lower user rates than those of the massive MIMO system without IRS. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel strategy for zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming design at the BS and reflection coefficients design at the IRS to efficiently null the inter-user interference. Under our proposed strategy, it is rigorously shown that even if the channel estimation overhead is considered, the IRS-assisted massive MIMO system can always achieve higher throughput compared to its counterpart without IRS, despite the fact that the favorable propagation property no longer holds.",

In contrast, we study in this paper an IRS-aided wireless network, where an IRS with only a finite number of phase shifts at each element is deployed to assist in the communication from a multi-antenna access point (AP) to a single-antenna user. We aim to minimize the transmit power at the AP by jointly optimizing the continuous transmit beamforming at the AP and discrete reflect beamforming at the IRS, subject to a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constraint at the user receiver. We first propose a suboptimal and low-complexity solution to the problem by applying the alternating optimization technique. Then, we analytically show that as compared to the ideal case with continuous phase shifts, the IRS with discrete phase shifts achieves the same squared power gain in terms of asymptotically large number of reflecting elements, while a constant performance loss is incurred that depends only on the number of phase-shift levels.

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present a label transfer model from texts to images for image classification tasks. The problem of image classification is often much more challenging than text classification. On one hand, labeled text data is more widely available than the labeled images for classification tasks. On the other hand, text data tends to have natural semantic interpretability, and they are often more directly related to class labels. On the contrary, the image features are not directly related to concepts inherent in class labels. One of our goals in this paper is to develop a model for revealing the functional relationships between text and image features as to directly transfer intermodal and intramodal labels to annotate the images. This is implemented by learning a transfer function as a bridge to propagate the labels between two multimodal spaces. However, the intermodal label transfers could be undermined by blindly transferring the labels of noisy texts to annotate images. To mitigate this problem, we present an intramodal label transfer process, which complements the intermodal label transfer by transferring the image labels instead when relevant text is absent from the source corpus. In addition, we generalize the inter-modal label transfer to zero-shot learning scenario where there are only text examples available to label unseen classes of images without any positive image examples. We evaluate our algorithm on an image classification task and show the effectiveness with respect to the other compared algorithms.",

There are different approaches associated with decentralized control strategy for coverage control problems. We perform a comparative review of these approaches and use the approach based on simple local coordination rules. We investigate this extensively used nearest neighbour rule based approach for developing coverage control algorithms. In this approach, a mobile robot gives an equal importance to every neighbour robot coming under its communication range. We develop our control approach by making some of the mobile robots playing a more influential role than other members in the team. The approach based on this control strategy becomes efficient in terms of achieving a consensus on control inputs, say heading angle, velocity, etc. The decentralized control of mobile robots can also exhibit a cyclic behaviour under some physical constraints like a quantized orientation of mobile robot. We further investigate the cyclic behaviour appearing due to the quantized control of mobile robots under some conditions. Our nearest neighbour rule based approach offers a biased strategy in case of cyclic behaviour appearing in the team of mobile robots. We consider a clustering technique inside the team of mobile robots. Our decentralized control strategy calculates the similarity measure among the neighbours of a mobile robot. The team of mobile robots with the similarity measure based approach becomes efficient in achieving a fast consensus like on heading angle or velocity. We perform a rigorous mathematical analysis of our developed approach. We also develop a condition based on relaxed criteria for achieving consensus on velocity or heading angle of the mobile robots.

Because of the directed nature of the follower graph on Twitter, we are further able to confirm more detailed forms of the friendship paradox: everyone you follow or who follows you has more friends and followers than you. This is likely caused by a correlation we demonstrate between Twitter activity, number of friends, and number of followers. In addition, we discover two new paradoxes: the virality paradox that states your friends receive more viral content than you, on average, and the activity paradox, which states your friends are more active than you, on average.\" The latter paradox is important in regulating online communication.It may result in users having difficulty maintaining optimal incoming information rates, because following additional users causes the volume of incoming tweets to increase super-linearly.While users may compensate for increased information flow by increasing their own activity, users become information overloaded when they receive more information than they are able or willing to process. We compare the average size of cascades that are sent and received by overloaded and underloaded users. And we show that overloaded users post and receive larger cascades and they are poor detector of small cascades.\n \n",

      "abstract": "Although community detection has drawn tremendous amount of attention across the sciences in the past decades, no formal consensus has been reached on the very nature of what qualifies a community as such. In this article we take an orthogonal approach by introducing a novel point of view to the problem of overlapping communities. Instead of quantifying the quality of a set of communities, we choose to focus on the intrinsic community-ness of one given set of nodes. To do so, we propose a general metric on graphs, the cohesion, based on counting triangles and inspired by well established sociological considerations. The model has been validated through a large-scale online experiment called Fellows in which users were able to compute their social groups on Face book and rate the quality of the obtained groups. By observing those ratings in relation to the cohesion we assess that the cohesion is a strong indicator of users subjective perception of the community-ness of a set of people.",

Hence, the goal of any WSN protocol is to implement energy efficient mechanisms that prolong the lifetime of WSNs. The existing face topology in WSNs can lead to high energy consumption due to all the nodes in the network being part of topology. In this paper, we propose a new protocol that introduces a new distributed energy-based face structure by putting redundant nodes to a sleep state for reduced energy consumption and prolonged lifetime of network. A distributed target tracking algorithm is designed to run on the new proposed face structure which tracks the target accurately while reducing the energy consumption of network. Additionally, a distributed fault tolerance algorithm is proposed which uses the sleeping redundant nodes in the network as backup nodes. When a node\u2019s battery reaches a critical level it selects a nearby sleep node to replace itself to minimize the interruption in tracking of the target. The simulation results show that our proposed scheme achieves better energy efficiency and improves the lifetime of network while maintaining the performance of tracking. At high speeds, our work achieves significant improvement in accuracy of tracking.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, the problem of distributed resource allocation is studied for an Internet of Things (IoT) system, composed of a heterogeneous group of nodes compromising both machine-type devices (MTDs) and human-type devices (HTDs). The problem is formulated as a noncooperative game between the heterogeneous IoT devices which seek to find the optimal time allocation so as to meet their quality-of-service (QoS) requirements in terms of energy, rate, and latency. Since the strategy space of each device is dependent on the actions of the other devices, the generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) solution is first characterized, and the conditions for uniqueness of the GNE are derived. Then, to explicitly capture the heterogeneity of the devices, in terms of resource constraints and QoS needs, a novel and more realistic game-theoretic approach, based on the behavioral framework of cognitive hierarchy (CH) theory, is proposed. This approach is then shown to enable the IoT devices to reach a CH equilibrium (CHE), a concept that takes into account the various levels of rationality corresponding to the heterogeneous computational capabilities and the information accessible for each one of the MTDs and HTDs. Simulation results show that the CHE solution maintains a stable performance. In particular, the proposed CHE solution keeps the percentage of devices with satisfied QoS constraints above 96% for IoT networks containing up to 10000 devices without considerably degrading the overall system performance in terms of the total utility. Simulation results also show that the proposed CHE solution brings a two-fold increase in the total rate of HTDs and deceases the total energy consumed by MTDs by 78% compared with the equal time policy.",

We consider a single-cell WiMAX environment in which the base station allocates sub channels to the subscriber stations in its coverage area. The sub channels allocated to a subscriber station are shared by multiple connections at that subscriber station. To ensure the Quality of Service (QoS) performances, two Connection Admission Control (CAC) schemes, namely, threshold-based and queue-aware CAC schemes are considered at a subscriber station. A queuing analytical framework for these admission control schemes is presented considering OFDMA-based transmission at the physical layer. Then, based on the queuing model, both the connection-level and the packetlevel performances are studied and compared with their analogues in the case without CAC. The connection arrival is modeled by a Poisson process and the packet arrival for a connection by a Markov Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP). We determine analytically and numerically different performance parameters, such as connection blocking probability, average number of ongoing connections, average queue length, packet dropping probability, queue throughput and average packet delay.",

We present a paradigm for the management of the cryptographic keys used by nodes to communicate, and we consider the problems connected with key generation, distribution, and replacement. In our paradigm, names are assigned to nodes by using a uniform scheme, which is based on the position of the given node in the node hierarchy. Each node holds a hierarchical key to communicate with its ancestors, and a level key to communicate with its siblings. A single, publicly known parametric one-way function is used to assign hierarchical keys to nodes, in an iterative procedure that starts from the key of the root of the node hierarchy, and proceeds downwards to the lowest hierarchical levels. A similar procedure is used to generate the level keys. The total memory requirements for key storage are extremely low. The number of keys exchanged in a key replacement process is kept to a minimum. Dynamic access control is fully supported, whereby new nodes can be added to the node hierarchy, and existing nodes can be evicted from the hierarchy.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are developing rapidly owing to flexible deployment and access services as air base stations. However, the channel errors of low-altitude communication links formed by mobile deployment of UAVs cannot be ignored. And the energy efficiency of the UAVs communication with imperfect channel state information (CSI) hasnt been well studied yet. Therefore, we focus on system performance optimization in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) UAV network considering imperfect CSI between the UAV and users. A suboptimal resource allocation scheme including user scheduling and power allocation is designed for maximizing energy efficiency. Because of the nonconvexity of optimization function with an probability constraint for imperfect CSI, the original problem is converted into a non-probability problem and then decoupled into two convex subproblems. First, a user scheduling method is applied in the two-side matching of users and subchannels by the difference of convex programming. Then based on user scheduling, the energy efficiency in UAV cells is optimized through a suboptimal power allocation algorithm by successive convex approximation method. The simulation results prove that the proposed algorithm is effective compared with existing resource allocation schemes.",

We introduce an attribute grammar framework for representing symbolic expressions. Given a grammar of math operators, we build trees that combine them in different ways, looking for compositions that are analytically equivalent to a target expression but of lower computational complexity. However, as the space of trees grows exponentially with the complexity of the target expression, brute force search is impractical for all but the simplest of expressions. Consequently, we introduce two novel learning approaches that are able to learn from simpler expressions to guide the tree search. The first of these is a simple n-gram model, the other being a recursive neural-network.

Approximately 25 \u2013 45% of children experience feeding difficulties with potential unhealthy outcomes such as growth failure, nutrient deficiencies and inappropriate motor skills development. Objectives: This study identified common problematic feeding behaviors of children less than four years of age referred to a specialized clinic and determined associations between responsiveness to treatment and number of problematic behaviors and clinic visits. Methods: Secondary data collected by trained researchers from 106 medical charts of patients seen over the last five years using appropriate data abstraction sheets included age, sex, anthropometric measures, medical history, dietary history and feeding-related behaviors. Clinical improvement in feeding behavior was defined as decreased frequency or cessation of a reported problematic feeding behavior. Responsive patients demonstrated such improvements within the first four appointments and those with no progress were considered non-responsive or complex cases. Data analysis included t-tests to determine associations between responsiveness to treatment and the number of problematic behaviors, frequency of clinic visits and presence of a medical condition. Results: Common problematic feeding behaviors included picky eating, refusal of solid foods, excessive fluid intake and poor appetite and the sum of all behaviors, not a single one, predicted case severity. The non-responsive group differed significantly from the responsive group with a higher number of problematic feeding behaviors (p<0.0001), more frequent clinic visits (p<0.0001) and more concurrent medical condition (p<0.0001). Conclusions: Establishing better definitions of problematic feeding behaviors and monitoring total behaviors and frequency of clinic visits may help determine complexity of cases. The study addressed gaps in the literature by characterizing the target population and acquiring data to better establish consistent nomenclature and categorization of feeding difficulties which would help design a future screening and ranking tool for appropriate intervention protocols.

Ziembicki CG 1, Gowans S2 1Clinical Nutrition, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, UniversityTitle: Can a Regular Hospital diet vs. Low Microbial diet lessen weight loss following an Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant? Ziembicki CG 1, Gowans S2 1Clinical Nutrition, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada. 2Academic Affairs, Research and Innovation, Collaborative Academic Practice, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario [R] Introduction: Individuals who receive a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) are initially immunocompromised and potentially at greater risk for food-related infections. Historically, these patients received a low microbial diet (LMD) to minimize this risk of food-borne infections. In August 2010, the practice at our centre was changed and all HSCT patients were given a liberalized, more palatable Regular Hospital Diet (REG) that met government food safety guidelines. Objective: Determine whether a REG diet attenuates Body Mass Index loss post HSCT, compared to a LMD diet. Methods: A retrospective chart audit of 50 individuals who received a HSCT was performed to generate a sample of 25 consecutive patients who received a LMD (March 2010-June 2010) or a REG diet (March 2011-June 2011) during their hospital stay. The two groups were compared on demographic and clinical characteristics to ensure groups were matched. The primary study outcome was BMI (kg/m2), computed at transplant, discharge and one week post discharge. BMI values were tested using 2-way ANOVA (diet x time). Results: Data from 48 patients (24 LMD and 24 REG) were analyzed (1 patient in each group died during their inpatient stay). There were no group differences on age, gender, diagnosis, donor type (related/unrelated), length of stay post HSCT(transplant to discharge) or total length of stay (admit to discharge). Both groups had a statistically significant but similar BMI loss, post HSCT (at transplant: LMD [25.7 \u00b13.6], REG [25.9 \u00b14.8]; at discharge: LMD [24.5\u00b13.2], REG [24.7\u00b14.3]; at 1 week post discharge: LMD [24.3\u00b13.2], REG [24.5\u00b14.4]). Conclusions: The liberalized REG diet did not significantly lessen BMI loss but neither did it increase weight loss. A REG diet remains the diet for HSCT patients at our centre because it is more palatable to patients, easier for patients to manage upon discharge and easier/less costly for the institution during their inpatient stay. Abstract Title: Diet and prostate cancer program: Evaluation and recommendations (DAPPER) Cosby C1, Sidhu S2, Stringer E3 1-3 BC Cancer Agency, Victoria, British Columbia [R]Title: Diet and prostate cancer program: Evaluation and recommendations (DAPPER) Cosby C1, Sidhu S2, Stringer E3 1-3 BC Cancer Agency, Victoria, British Columbia [R] Introduction: Diet may be an important factor in prostate cancer incidence as well as recurrence although the relationship remains unclear. A high BMI is associated with higher recurrence rates after radical prostectomy or radiation therapy. Evidence suggests that reduction in biomarkers, such as insulin growth factor hormone, which may influence recurrence of prostate cancer can be achieved with weight loss of only 5-10%. Research indicates that men with prostate cancer are very motivated to make changes to their diet and suggests use of specialized dietary information that would convey the how and why for dietary changes to optimize adoption. However, very little is understood about what types of interventions in conveying this information may be effective in increasing nutrition knowledge and facilitating healthy dietary changes that may promote healthy body weights. Objective: To evaluate effectiveness and satisfaction of a weekly diet and prostate group education program in meeting the information needs in promoting healthy body weights. Methods: Forty-eight men with prostate cancer were recruited for the DAPPER study using convenience sampling and the men attended one diet and prostate cancer group education session facilitated by a registered dietitian. The men completed the revised validated general nutrition knowledge questionnaire (GNKQ-R) that included 3 open-ended questions at two time points: pre-session and then, 2 weeks post-session that included a satisfaction questionnaire. Results: Descriptive statistics and thematic analysis were used to identify changes in learning, level of satisfaction. Significant differences occurred between mean GNKQ-R scores of the pre-session (70.19 \u00b122.71) and the post-session (78.45 \u00b118.46) (95% CI, p <0.0005). The sessions were mostly satisfactory for meeting their needs (94% satisfied) with the highest ratings seen in level of usefulness of the information and instructor knowledge. Three themes emerged from the qualitative analysis: Importance of the diet information, integrative approach, and value of group learning. Conclusions: Diet and prostate cancer group education sessions were effective and mostly satisfactory approaches for meeting the diet information needs in this population.

Sarcopenia, defined as a loss of SMM and loss of skeletal muscle strength, has been associated with numerous poor transplantation outcomes including: increased infections; length of stay; and mortality. Research indicates a two-fold increase in mortality in sarcopenic liver cirrhotic patients, compared to non-sarcopenic patients, independent of liver dysfunction. Currently, the sodium model for end-stage liver disease [Na-MELD] score is used to stratify patients based on their risk of death while on the liver transplantation [LTx] waiting list. However, this scoring system does not incorporate markers of nutritional status, or SMM loss. Objective: To determine if there is a relationship between nutritional status, low SMM and Na-MELD in cirrhotic patients awaiting LTx. Methods: A prospective study from July 2016-current, using quadriceps muscle layer thickness [QMLT] measurements in a cohort of adult patients assessed for liver transplantation was undertaken. A portable ultrasound machine SONOSITE S-ICU was used to capture and measure QMLT. Patients were stratified as low Na-MELD and high Na-M",

Intensive studies have been done to provide energy efficient power management mechanisms. In this paper, we present PAS, a Prediction-based Adaptive Sleeping mechanism for environment monitoring sensor networks to conserve energy. PAS focuses on the diffusion stimulus (DS) scenario, which is very common and important in the application of environment monitoring. Different with most of previous works, PAS explores the features of DS spreading process to obtain higher energy efficiency. In PAS, sensors determine their sleeping schedules based on the observed emergency of DS spreading. While sensors near the DS boundary stay awake to accurately capture the possible stimulus arrival, the far away sensors turn into sleeping mode to conserve energy. Simulation experiment shows that PAS largely reduces the energy cost without decreasing system performance.",

      "abstract": "With the cellular networks becoming increasingly agile, a major challenge lies in how to support diverse services for mobile users (MUs) over a common physical network infrastructure. Network slicing is a promising solution to tailor the network to match such service requests. This paper considers a system with radio access network (RAN)-only slicing, where the physical infrastructure is split into slices providing computation and communication functionalities. A limited number of channels are auctioned across scheduling slots to MUs of multiple service providers (SPs) (i.e., the tenants). Each SP behaves selfishly to maximize the expected long-term payoff from the competition with other SPs for the orchestration of channels, which provides its MUs with the opportunities to access the computation and communication slices. This problem is modelled as a stochastic game, in which the decision makings of a SP depend on the global network dynamics as well as the joint control policy of all SPs. To approximate the Nash equilibrium solutions, we first construct an abstract stochastic game with the local conjectures of channel auction among the SPs. We then linearly decompose the per-SP Markov decision process to simplify the decision makings at a SP and derive an online scheme based on deep reinforcement learning to approach the optimal abstract control policies. Numerical experiments show significant performance gains from our scheme.",

However, due to the high mobility of cellular devices, establishing and ensuring the success of D2D transmission become a major challenge. To this end, in this paper, a novel framework is proposed to enable devices to form multi-hop D2D connections in an effort to maintain sustainable communication in the presence of device mobility. To solve the problem posed by device mobility, in contrast to existing works, which mostly focus on physical domain information, a durable community-based approach is introduced taking social encounters into context. It is shown that the proposed scheme can derive an optimal solution for time sensitive content transmission while also minimizing the cost that the base station pays in order to incentivize users to participate in D2D. Simulation results show that the proposed social community aware approach yields significant performance gain, in terms of the amount of traffic offloaded from the cellular network to the D2D tier, compared with the classical social-unaware methods.",

The proposed algorithm uses a fixed 3x3 window for the increasing noise densities. The pixels in the current window are arranged in sorting order using a improved snake like sorting algorithm with reduced comparator. The processed pixel is checked for the occurrence of outliers, if the absolute difference between processed pixels is greater than fixed threshold. Under high noise densities the processed pixel is also noisy hence the median is checked using the above procedure. if found true then the pixel is considered as noisy hence the corrupted pixel is replaced by the median of the current processing window. If median is also noisy then replace the corrupted pixel with unsymmetrical trimmed median else if the pixel is termed uncorrupted and left unaltered. The proposed algorithm (PA) is tested on varying detail images for various noises. The proposed algorithm effectively removes the high density fixed value impulse noise, low density random valued impulse noise, low density Gaussian noise and lower proportion of mixed noise.

This model belongs to the class of Consensus-Based Optimization. In fact, particles move on the sphere driven by a drift towards an instantaneous consensus point, which is computed as a convex combination of particle locations, weighted by the cost function according to Laplace's principle, and it represents an approximation to a global minimizer. The dynamics is further perturbed by a random vector field to favor exploration, whose variance is a function of the distance of the particles to the consensus point. In particular, as soon as the consensus is reached the stochastic component vanishes. The main results of this paper are about the proof of convergence of the numerical scheme to global minimizers provided conditions of well-preparation of the initial datum. The proof combines previous results of mean-field limit with a novel asymptotic analysis, and classical convergence results of numerical methods for SDE. We present several numerical experiments, which show that the algorithm proposed in the present paper scales well with the dimension and is extremely versatile. To quantify the performances of the new approach, we show that the algorithm is able to perform essentially as good as ad hoc state of the art methods in challenging problems in signal processing and machine learning, namely the phase retrieval problem and the robust subspace detection.",

However, the optimization problem there has a non-linear objective and non-linear constraints with special structure. Since gradients of both the objective as well as constraints of this optimization problem are well defined, gradient based schemes seem to be a natural choice. We discuss a gradient scheme tuned for two-player stochastic games. We show in simulations that this scheme indeed converges to a Nash equilibrium, for a simple terrain exploration problem modelled as a general-sum stochastic game. However, it turns out that only global minima of the optimization problem correspond to Nash equilibria of the underlying general-sum stochastic game, while gradient schemes only guarantee convergence to local minima.

The existing approaches solely rely on the channel\u2019s frequency response, and the hybrid beamformers maximize the average spectral efficiency over the whole frequency band. Compared to state-of-the-art, we show that substantial sum-rate gains can be achieved, both for rich and sparse scattering channels, by jointly exploiting the frequency- and time-domain characteristics of the massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels. In our proposed approach, the radio frequency (RF) beamformer coherently combines the received symbols in the time domain and, thus, it concentrates the signal\u2019s power on a specific time sample. As a result, the RF beamformer flattens the frequency response of the \u201ceffective\u201d transmission channel and reduces its root-mean-square delay spread. Then, a baseband combiner mitigates the residual interference in the frequency domain. We present the closed-form expressions of the proposed beamformer and its performance by leveraging the favorable propagation condition of massive MIMO channels, and we prove that our proposed scheme can achieve the performance of fully digital zero-forcing when the number of employed phases shifter networks is twice the resolvable multipath components in the time domain.",

      "abstract": "Millimeter-wave (mm-wave) communications plays an important role in future cellular networks because of the vast amount of spectrum available in the underutilized mm-wave frequency bands. To overcome the huge free space omnidirectional path loss in those frequency bands, the deployment of a very large number of antenna elements at the base station is crucial. The complexity, power consumption, and costs resulting from the large number of antenna elements can be reduced by limiting the number of RF chains. This leads to hybrid precoding and combining, which, in contrast to the traditional fully digital precoding and combining, moves a part of the signal processing from the digital to the analog domain. This paper proposes new algorithms for the design of hybrid precoders and combiners in a multiuser scenario. The algorithms are based on the previously proposed linear successive allocation method developed for the traditional fully digital version. It successively allocates data streams to users and suppresses the respective interstream interference in two stages, which perfectly matches the hybrid architecture. Furthermore, a low-complexity version is developed by exploiting the typical structure of mm-wave channels. The good performance of the proposed method and its low-complexity version is demonstrated by simulation results.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, the problem of joint caching and resource allocation is investigated for a network of cache-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that service wireless ground users over the LTE licensed and unlicensed bands. The considered model focuses on users that can access both licensed and unlicensed bands while receiving contents from either the cache units at the UAVs directly or via content server-UAV-user links. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem, which jointly incorporates user association, spectrum allocation, and content caching. To solve this problem, a distributed algorithm based on the machine learning framework of liquid state machine (LSM) is proposed. Using the proposed LSM algorithm, the cloud can predict the users\u2019 content request distribution while having only limited information on the network\u2019s and users\u2019 states. The proposed algorithm also enables the UAVs to autonomously choose the optimal resource allocation strategies that maximize the number of users with stable queues depending on the network states. Based on the users\u2019 association and content request distributions, the optimal contents that need to be cached at UAVs and the optimal resource allocation are derived. Simulation results using real datasets show that the proposed approach yields up to 17.8% and 57.1% gains, respectively, in terms of the number of users that have stable queues compared with two baseline algorithms: Q-learning with cache and Q-learning without cache. The results also show that the LSM significantly improves the convergence time of up to 20% compared with conventional learning algorithms such as Q-learning.",

To study the interplay between short-scale commuting flows and long-range airline traffic in shaping the spatiotemporal pattern of a global epidemic we (i) analyze mobility data from 29 countries around the world and find a gravity model able to provide a global description of commuting patterns up to 300 kms and (ii) integrate in a worldwide-structured metapopulation epidemic model a timescale-separation technique for evaluating the force of infection due to multiscale mobility processes in the disease dynamics. Commuting flows are found, on average, to be one order of magnitude larger than airline flows. However, their introduction into the worldwide model shows that the large-scale pattern of the simulated epidemic exhibits only small variations with respect to the baseline case where only airline traffic is considered. The presence of short-range mobility increases, however, the synchronization of subpopulations in close proximity and affects the epidemic behavior at the periphery of the airline transportation infrastructure. The present approach outlines the possibility for the definition of layered computational approaches where different modeling assumptions and granularities can be used consistently in a unifying multiscale framework.",

In this paper, we propose a game theory based algorithm to the grid load balancing problem on the principle of minimizing the cost of the grid. The grid load-balancing problem is treated as a non-cooperative game. The experiment results demonstrate that the game based algorithm has a desirable capability to reduce the cost of the grid.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) used for static portable executable (PE) malware detection typically employs per-file numerical feature vector representations as input with one or more target labels during training. However, there is much orthogonal information that can be gleaned from the \\textit{context} in which the file was seen. In this paper, we propose utilizing a static source of contextual information -- the path of the PE file -- as an auxiliary input to the classifier. While file paths are not malicious or benign in and of themselves, they do provide valuable context for a malicious/benign determination. Unlike dynamic contextual information, file paths are available with little overhead and can seamlessly be integrated into a multi-view static ML detector, yielding higher detection rates at very high throughput with minimal infrastructural changes. Here we propose a multi-view neural network, which takes feature vectors from PE file content as well as corresponding file paths as inputs and outputs a detection score. To ensure realistic evaluation, we use a dataset of approximately 10 million samples -- files and file paths from user endpoints of an actual security vendor network. We then conduct an interpretability analysis via LIME modeling to ensure that our classifier has learned a sensible representation and see which parts of the file path most contributed to change in the classifier's score. We find that our model learns useful aspects of the file path for classification, while also learning artifacts from customers testing the vendor's product, e.g., by downloading a directory of malware samples each named as their hash. We prune these artifacts from our test dataset and demonstrate reductions in false negative rate of 32.3% at a $10^{-3}$ false positive rate (FPR) and 33.1% at $10^{-4}$ FPR, over a similar topology single input PE file content only model.",

Such test alarms lay an almost unbearable burden on software testing engineers who have to manually analyze the causes of these alarms. The causes are critical because they decide which stakeholders are responsible to fix the bugs detected during the testing. In this paper, we present a novel approach that aims to relieve the burden by automating the procedure. Our approach, called Cause Analysis Model, exploits information retrieval techniques to efficiently infer test alarm causes based on test logs. We have developed a prototype and evaluated our tool on two industrial datasets with more than 14,000 test alarms. Experiments on the two datasets show that our tool achieves an accuracy of 58.3% and 65.8%, respectively, which outperforms the baseline algorithms by up to 13.3%. Our algorithm is also extremely efficient, spending about 0.1s per cause analysis. Due to the attractive experimental results, our industrial partner, a leading information and communication technology company in the world, has deployed the tool and it achieves an average accuracy of 72% after two months of running, nearly three times more accurate than a previous strategy based on regular expressions.",

In this paper we present a novel method to detect, assess and mitigate OSS vulnerabilities that improves on state-of-the-art approaches, which commonly depend on metadata to identify vulnerable OSS dependencies. Our solution instead is code-centric and combines static and dynamic analysis to determine the reachability of the vulnerable portion of libraries used (directly or transitively) by an application.

In this work, we take the first concrete steps to understand the characteristics of abusive behavior in Twitter, one of today\u2019s largest social media platforms. We analyze 1.2 million users and 2.1 million tweets, comparing users participating in discussions around seemingly normal topics like the NBA, to those more likely to be hate-related, such as the Gamergate controversy, or the gender pay inequality at the BBC station. We also explore specific manifestations of abusive behavior, i.e., cyberbullying and cyberaggression, in one of the hate-related communities (Gamergate). We present a robust methodology to distinguish bullies and aggressors from normal Twitter users by considering text, user, and network-based attributes. Using various state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms, we classify these accounts with over 90% accuracy and AUC. Finally, we discuss the current status of Twitter user accounts marked as abusive by our methodology and study the performance of potential mechanisms that can be used by Twitter to suspend users in the future.",

Early detection is the key to success in skin cancer treatment. However, skin cancer diagnosis is still a challenge, even for experienced dermatologists, due to strong resemblances between benign and malignant lesions. To aid dermatologists in skin cancer diagnosis, we developed a deep learning system that can effectively and automatically classify skin lesions into one of the seven classes: (1) Actinic Keratoses, (2) Basal Cell Carcinoma, (3) Benign Keratosis, (4) Dermatofibroma, (5) Melanocytic nevi, (6) Melanoma, (7) Vascular Skin Lesion. The HAM10000 dataset was used to train the system. An end-to-end deep learning process, transfer learning technique, utilizing multiple pre-trained models, combining with class-weighted and focal loss were applied for the classification process. The result was that our ensemble of modified ResNet50 models can classify skin lesions into one of the seven classes with top-1, top-2 and top-3 accuracy 93%, 97% and 99%, respectively.

      "abstract": "Online social networks offer convenient ways to reach out to large audiences. In particular, Facebook pages are increasingly used by businesses, brands, and organizations to connect with multitudes of users worldwide. As the number of likes of a page has become a de-facto measure of its popularity and profitability, an underground market of services artificially inflating page likes (\u201clike farms\u201d) has emerged alongside Facebook\u2019s official targeted advertising platform. Nonetheless, besides a few media reports, there is little work that systematically analyzes Facebook pages\u2019 promotion methods. Aiming to fill this gap, we present a honeypot-based comparative measurement study of page likes garnered via Facebook advertising and from popular like farms. First, we analyze likes based on demographic, temporal, and social characteristics and find that some farms seem to be operated by bots and do not really try to hide the nature of their operations, while others follow a stealthier approach, mimicking regular users\u2019 behavior. Next, we look at fraud detection algorithms currently deployed by Facebook and show that they do not work well to detect stealthy farms that spread likes over longer timespans and like popular pages to mimic regular users. To overcome their limitations, we investigate the feasibility of timeline-based detection of like farm accounts, focusing on characterizing content generated by Facebook accounts on their timelines as an indicator of genuine versus fake social activity. We analyze a wide range of features extracted from timeline posts, which we group into two main categories: lexical and non-lexical. We find that like farm accounts tend to re-share content more often, use fewer words and poorer vocabulary, and more often generate duplicate comments and likes compared to normal users. Using relevant lexical and non-lexical features, we build a classifier to detect like farms accounts that achieves a precision higher than 99% and a 93% recall.",

This paper presents an empirical study that compares varied classification algorithms on two datasets of MCA (Masters in Computer Applications) students collected from various affiliated colleges of a reputed state university in India. One dataset includes only primary attributes, whereas other dataset is feeded with secondary psychometric attributes in it. The results showcase that solely primary academic attributes do not lead to smart prediction accuracy of students employability, once they square measure within the initial year of their education.

      "abstract": "Template-matching methods for visual tracking have gained popularity recently due to their good performance and fast speed. However, they lack effective ways to adapt to changes in the target object's appearance, making their tracking accuracy still far from state-of-the-art. In this paper, we propose a dynamic memory network to adapt the template to the target's appearance variations during tracking. The reading and writing process of the external memory is controlled by an LSTM network with the search feature map as input. A spatial attention mechanism is applied to concentrate the LSTM input on the potential target as the location of the target is at first unknown. To prevent aggressive model adaptivity, we apply gated residual template learning to control the amount of retrieved memory that is used to combine with the initial template. In order to alleviate the drift problem, we also design a \u201cnegative\u201d memory unit that stores templates for distractors, which are used to cancel out wrong responses from the object template. To further boost the tracking performance, an auxiliary classification loss is added after the feature extractor part. Unlike tracking-by-detection methods where the object's information is maintained by the weight parameters of neural networks, which requires expensive online fine-tuning to be adaptable, our tracker runs completely feed-forward and adapts to the target's appearance changes by updating the external memory. Moreover, the capacity of our model is not determined by the network size as with other trackers \u2013 the capacity can be easily enlarged as the memory requirements of a task increase, which is favorable for memorizing long-term object information. Extensive experiments on the OTB and VOT datasets demonstrate that our trackers perform favorably against state-of-the-art tracking methods while retaining real-time speed.",

However, the existing routing protocols used in MANETs are not secured and faced many security challenges which degrade the performance of the network. Therefore, there is need to build security feature in the existing routing protocol to enhance its performance in the face of emerging threats. In this paper, a proposed model was formulated to provide secure routing in MANET. The model used Public key cryptography also known as RSA with MD5 for authentication and observation-based cooperation enforcement and graph theory-based trust and reputation techniques, built on AODV routing protocol to enhance its security. The simulation of the model was carried out in NS2.35. Performance evaluation of the proposed model AODVRM was carried out by comparing its performance with an existing protocol, AODV using metrics like throughput, End-to-End delay and Packet delivery ratio. Simulation result showed that the proposed AODVRM recorded throughput of 291,502,502,461,506 kilo bytes per seconds (kbps), packet delivery ratio of 94%, 95%, 95%, 86%, 83% and an end-to-end delay of 132, 235, 272, 272, 258 seconds.

The performance of CBIR process not only decided by the optimum features extracted from the image but also on the proper choice of the similarity / dissimilarity measures (distance metrics). As the image features broadly diversified in terms of color, texture and shape based, using the same distance metric may not work well for all of these features. In this paper, first we presented overview of geometric and statistical distance metrics used in CBIR along with the comparative analysis of these measures on color and texture features. Color features extracted by computing color histograms in HSV space and texture features by wavelet decompositions. Geometrical distances such as Manhattan, Chebyshev, Euclidean, statistical distance metrics such as Cosine Similarity, Chi-square, KullbackLeibler, Jeffrey and cumulative statistical distance metrics of KolmogorovSmirnov, Cramer von Mises and Earthmover's distances were analyzed for feature similarity.

A robust Cubature Kalman Filter (RCKF) based approach is proposed for dynamic state estimation (DSE) of generators under cyber attacks in this paper. First, two types of cyber attacks, namely false data injection and denial of service attacks, are modelled and thereby introduced into DSE of a generator by mixing the attack vectors with the measurement data; Second, under cyber attacks with different degrees of sophistication, the RCKF algorithm and the Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF) algorithm are adopted to the DSE, and then the two algorithms are compared and discussed. The novelty of this study lies primarily in our attempt to introduce cyber attacks into DSE of generators. The simulation results on the IEEE 9-bus system and the New England 16-machine 68-bus system verify the effectiveness and superiority of the RCKF.",

We derive the expressions for successful transmission probabilities and ergodic service rates.

Novel distributed adaptive consensus protocols are proposed to achieve leader\u2013follower consensus for any directed graph containing a directed spanning tree with the leader as the root node and leaderless consensus for strongly connected directed graphs. It is pointed out that the adaptive protocols involve undesirable parameter drift phenomenon when bounded external disturbances exist. By using the \u03c3 modification technique, distributed robust adaptive consensus protocols are designed to guarantee the ultimate boundedness of both the consensus error and the adaptive coupling weights in the presence of external disturbances. All the adaptive protocols in this paper are fully distributed, relying on only the agent dynamics and the relative states of neighbouring agents.",

      "abstract": "This paper focuses on recursive nonlinear least-squares parameter estimation in multiagent networks, where the individual agents observe sequentially over time an independent and identically distributed time-series consisting of a nonlinear function of the true but unknown parameter corrupted by noise. A distributed recursive estimator of the consensus + innovations type, namely CIWNLS, is proposed, in which the agents update their parameter estimates at each observation sampling epoch in a collaborative way by simultaneously processing the latest locally sensed information (innovations) and the parameter estimates from other agents (consensus) in the local neighborhood conforming to a prespecified interagent communication topology. Under rather weak conditions on the connectivity of the interagent communication and a global observability criterion, it is shown that, at every network agent, CIWNLS leads to consistent parameter estimates. Furthermore, under standard smoothness assumptions on the local observation functions, the distributed estimator is shown to yield order-optimal convergence rates, i.e., as far as the order of pathwise convergence is concerned, the local parameter estimates at each agent are as good as the optimal centralized nonlinear least-squares estimator that requires access to all the observations across all the agents at all times. To benchmark the performance of the CIWNLS estimator with that of the centralized nonlinear least-squares estimator, the asymptotic normality of the estimate sequence is established, and the asymptotic covariance of the distributed estimator is evaluated. Finally, simulation results are presented that illustrate and verify the analytical findings.",

      "abstract": "With the evolution of wireless technology and use of mobile devices, Mobile Ad-hoc Network has become popular among researchers to explore. A mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is a self-configuring network of mobile routers (and associated hosts) connected by wireless links. The routers and hosts are free to move randomly and organize themselves arbitrarily. It allows mobile nodes to communicate directly without any centralized coordinator. Such network scenarios cannot rely on centralized and organized connectivity, and can be conceived as applications of Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks. Thus, MANET is vulnerable due to its dynamic network topology, as any node become untrusted at any time. The Black hole attack is one kind of security risk in which malicious node advertises itself to have a shortest path for any destination, to forge data or for DOS attack. In this paper, to detect such nodes effectively, we propose a Permutation based Acknowledgement for most widely used reactive protocol ad-hoc on demand distance vector routing AODV. This mechanism is enhancement of Adaptive Acknowledgement (AACK) and TWO-ACK, here we have tried to show the efficiency increment by decreasing number of messages routed in the network.",

      "abstract": "The accurate numerical simulation of high Reynolds number incompressible flows is a challenging topic in computational fluid dynamics. Classical inf-sup stable methods like the Taylor-Hood element or only $L^2$-conforming discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods relax the divergence constraint in the variational formulation. However, unlike divergence-free methods, this relaxation leads to a pressure-dependent contribution in the velocity error which is proportional to the inverse of the viscosity, thus resulting in methods that lack pressure robustness and have difficulties in preserving structures at high Reynolds numbers. The present paper addresses the discretization of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with high-order DG methods in the framework of projection methods. The major focus in this article is threefold: i) We present a novel postprocessing technique in the projection step of the splitting scheme that reconstructs the Helmholtz flux in $H(\\text{div})$. In contrast to the previously introduced $H(\\text{div})$ postprocessing technique, the resulting velocity field is pointwise divergence-free in addition to satisfying the discrete continuity equation. ii) Based on this Helmholtz flux $H(\\text{div})$ reconstruction, we obtain a high order in space, pressure robust splitting scheme as numerical experiments in this paper demonstrate. iii) With this pressure robust splitting scheme, we demonstrate that a robust DG method for underresolved turbulent incompressible flows can be realized.",

Contrary to the common assumption of a homogeneous user domain, we analyze two-tier user domain, whose transmit powers depend purely on the association process. The derived joint association probabilities and the distributions of the distance to the serving base station give deeper insight into the fundamentals of a system with decoupled access.

      "abstract": "Deep ConvNets have shown great performance for single-label image classification (e.g. ImageNet), but it is necessary to move beyond the single-label classification task because pictures of everyday life are inherently multi-label. Multi-label classification is a more difficult task than single-label classification because both the input images and output label spaces are more complex. Furthermore, collecting clean multi-label annotations is more difficult to scale-up than single-label annotations. To reduce the annotation cost, we propose to train a model with partial labels i.e. only some labels are known per image. We first empirically compare different labeling strategies to show the potential for using partial labels on multi-label datasets. Then to learn with partial labels, we introduce a new classification loss that exploits the proportion of known labels per example. Our approach allows the use of the same training settings as when learning with all the annotations. We further explore several curriculum learning based strategies to predict missing labels. Experiments are performed on three large-scale multi-label datasets: MS COCO, NUS-WIDE and Open Images.",

Different from previous low-level edge detection, our algorithm focuses on detecting higher-level object contours. Our network is trained end-to-end on PASCAL VOC with refined ground truth from inaccurate polygon annotations, yielding much higher precision in object contour detection than previous methods. We find that the learned model generalizes well to unseen object classes from the same supercategories on MS COCO and can match state-of-the-art edge detection on BSDS500 with fine-tuning. By combining with the multiscale combinatorial grouping algorithm, our method can generate high-quality segmented object proposals, which significantly advance the state-of-the-art on PASCAL VOC (improving average recall from 0.62 to 0.67) with a relatively small amount of candidates (~1660 per image).",

Particularly, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and two orthogonal multiple access (OMA) schemes, namely, time division multiple access (TDMA) and frequency division multiple access (FDMA), are studied. The objective is to maximize the system average sum rate for the delay-tolerant transmission. We propose two adjustment schemes, namely, dynamic phase adjustment and one-time phase adjustment. The power budget, minimum average data rate, and discrete unit modulus reflection coefficient are considered as constrains. To solve the problem, two phase shifters adjustment algorithms with low complexity are proposed to obtain near optimal solutions. With given phase shifters and satisfaction of time-sharing condition, the optimal resource allocations are obtained using the Lagrangian dual decomposition. The numerical results reveal that: i) the average sum rate of proposed NOMA network aided by IRS outperforms the conventional NOMA network over fading channels; ii) with continuous IRS adjustment in the fading block, the proposed TDMA scheme performs better than the FDMA scheme; iii) increasing the minimum average user rate requirement has less impact on the proposed IRS-NOMA system than on the IRS-OMA system.",

      "abstract": "Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a new and revolutionizing technology for achieving spectrum and energy efficient wireless networks. By leveraging massive low-cost passive elements that are able to reflect radio-frequency (RF) signals with adjustable phase shifts, IRS can achieve high passive beamforming gains, which are particularly appealing for improving the efficiency of RF-based wireless power transfer. Motivated by the above, we study in this paper an IRS-assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system. Specifically, a set of IRSs are deployed to assist in the information/power transfer from a multi-antenna access point (AP) to multiple single-antenna information users (IUs) and energy users (EUs), respectively. We aim to minimize the transmit power at the AP via jointly optimizing its transmit precoders and the reflect phase shifts at all IRSs, subject to the quality-of-service (QoS) constraints at all users, namely, the individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at IUs and the energy harvesting constraints at EUs. However, this optimization problem is non-convex with intricately coupled variables, for which the existing alternating optimization approach is shown to be inefficient as the number of QoS constraints increases. To tackle this challenge, we first apply proper transformations on the QoS constraints and then propose an efficient iterative algorithm by applying the penalty-based optimization method. Moreover, by exploiting the short-range coverage of IRS, we further propose a more computationally efficient algorithm by optimizing the phase shifts at all IRSs in parallel. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of employing multiple IRSs for enhancing the performance of SWIPT systems as well as the significant performance gains achieved by our proposed algorithms over benchmark schemes. The impact of IRS on the transmitter/receiver design for SWIPT is also unveiled.",

      "abstract": "Anonymity in Bit coin, a peer-to-peer electronic currency system, is a complicated issue. Within the system, users are identified by public-keys only. An attacker wishing to de-anonymize its users will attempt to construct the one to-many mapping between users and public-keys and associate information external to the system with the users. Bitcoinfrustrates this attack by storing the mapping of a user to his or her public-keys on that user's node only and by allowing each user to generate as many public-keys as required. In this paper we consider the topological structure of two networks derived from Bitcoin's public transaction history. We show that the two networks have a non-trivial topological structure, provide complementary views of the Bit coin system and have implications for anonymity. We combine these structures with external information and techniques such as context discovery and flow analysis to investigate an alleged theft of Bit coins, which, at the time of the theft, had a market value of approximately half a million U.S. dollars.",

Graphs were generated, using R and Gephi, in which nodes represent addresses and edges represent the exchange of bitcoin. The six hour data set was subsetted into a one and two hour sampling snapshot of the network. We performed comparisons and analysis on all subsets of the data in an effort to determine the minimum sampling length that represented the network as a whole. Our results suggest that the six hour sampling was the minimum limit with respect to sampling time needed to accurately characterize the bitcoin transaction network.Anonymity is a desired feature of the blockchain and bitcoin network however, it limited us in our analysis and conclusions we drew from our results were mostly inferred.

      "abstract": "Enterprise networks face a large number of threats that are managed and mitigated with a combination of proprietary and third-party security tools and services. However, the techniques and principles employed by the said tools, processes, and services are quite conventional. They lack the rapid evolution, as required to protect against modern, state-of-the-art threats faced, specifically, against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. The lack of efficiency of a network is directly proportional to the number of applications and services it hosts, mainly to protect against external and internal threats. Moreover, the effectiveness of such security mechanisms relies on their independent and proactive approach, which is useful for known malware and their attack vectors, but become obsolete when there is a new malware or zero-day vulnerability is exploits. This paper presents an intelligent, highly responsive, and scalable security framework for enterprise networks. The proposed framework incorporates Apache Spark Framework for security analytics. It accurately identifies anomalies related to DDoS attacks from real-time network traffic by using customized machine learning algorithms, meticulously trained against selected feature-set. Encouraging results are obtained when tested against different scenarios and bench-marked with the results achieved by related studies in similar scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has become a promising technology to exploit the new dimension of the power domain to enhance the spectral efficiency of wireless networks. However, most existing NOMA schemes rely on the strong assumption that users\u2019 channel gains are quite different, which may be invalid in practice. To unleash the potential of power-domain NOMA, we propose a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-empowered NOMA scheme to introduce desirable channel gain differences among the users by adjusting the phase shifts at the RIS. Our goal is to minimize the total transmit power by jointly optimizing the beamforming vectors at the base station, the phase-shift matrix at the RIS, and user ordering. To address challenge due to the highly coupled optimization variables, we present an alternating optimization framework to decompose the non-convex bi-quadratically constrained quadratic problem under a specific user ordering into two rank-one constrained matrices optimization problems via matrix lifting. To accurately detect the feasibility of the non-convex rank-one constraints and improve performance by avoiding early stopping in the alternating optimization procedure, we equivalently represent the rank-one constraint as the difference between nuclear norm and spectral norm. A difference-of-convex (DC) algorithm is further developed to solve the resulting DC programs via successive convex relaxation, followed by establishing the convergence of the proposed DC-based alternating optimization method. We further propose an efficient user ordering scheme with closed-form expressions, considering both the channel conditions and users\u2019 target data rates. Simulation results validate the ability of an RIS in enlarging the channel-gain difference when the users\u2019 original channel conditions are similar and the superiority of the proposed DC-based alternating optimization method in reducing the total transmit power.",

In this network, multiple RISs are spatially distributed to serve wireless users and the energy efficiency of the network is maximized by dynamically controlling the on-off status of each RIS as well as optimizing the reflection coefficients matrix of the RISs. This problem is posed as a joint optimization problem of transmit beamforming and RIS control, whose goal is to maximize the energy efficiency under minimum rate constraints of the users. To solve this problem, two iterative algorithms are proposed for the single-user case and multi-user case. For the single-user case, the phase optimization problem is solved by using a successive convex approximation method, which admits a closed-form solution at each step. Moreover, the optimal RIS on-off status is obtained by using the dual method. For the multi-user case, a low-complexity greedy searching method is proposed to solve the RIS on-off optimization problem. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves up to 33% and 68% gains in terms of the energy efficiency in both single-user and multi-user cases compared to the conventional RIS scheme and amplify-and-forward relay scheme, respectively.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, the deployment of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a flying base station used to provide the fly wireless communications to a given geographical area is analyzed. In particular, the coexistence between the UAV, that is transmitting data in the downlink, and an underlaid device-to-device (D2D) communication network is considered. For this model, a tractable analytical framework for the coverage and rate analysis is derived. Two scenarios are considered: a static UAV and a mobile UAV. In the first scenario, the average coverage probability and the system sum-rate for the users in the area are derived as a function of the UAV altitude and the number of D2D users. In the second scenario, using the disk covering problem, the minimum number of stop points that the UAV needs to visit in order to completely cover the area is computed. Furthermore, considering multiple retransmissions for the UAV and D2D users, the overall outage probability of the D2D users is derived. Simulation and analytical results show that, depending on the density of D2D users, the optimal values for the UAV altitude, which lead to the maximum system sum-rate and coverage probability, exist. Moreover, our results also show that, by enabling the UAV to intelligently move over the target area, the total required transmit power of UAV while covering the entire area, can be minimized. Finally, in order to provide full coverage for the area of interest, the tradeoff between the coverage and delay, in terms of the number of stop points, is discussed.",

We propose an optimization scheme, including task assignment, power allocation and user association, to minimize energy consumption. Specifically, we transform the probabilistic problem into a non-probabilistic one. To efficiently solve this nonconvex energy minimization problem, we first investigate the one-user two-BS case and derive the optimal closed-form expressions of task assignment and power allocation via the bilevel programming method. Subsequently, based on the derived optimal solution, we propose a low complexity algorithm for the user association in the multi-user multi-BS scenario. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can yield much better performance than the conventional OMA scheme and the identical results with lower complexity from the exhaustive search with the small number of BSs.",

Although the massive MIMO technology can improve the spectral efficiency (SE) of cellular networks by configuring a large number of antennas at base stations (BSs), the energy consumption of radio frequency (RF) chains increases dramatically. The increment of energy consumption is caused by the increase of RF chain number to match the antenna number in massive MIMO communication systems. To overcome this problem, a generalized spatial modulation (GSM) solution is presented to simultaneously reduce the number of RF chains and maintain the SE of massive MIMO communication systems. A EE model is proposed to estimate the transmission and computation power of massive MIMO communication systems with GSM. Simulation results demonstrate that the EE of massive MIMO communication systems with GSM outperforms the massive MIMO communication systems without GSM.

      "abstract": "There are numerous research challenges that need to be addressed until a wide deployment of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) becomes possible. One of the critical issues consists of the design of scalable routing algorithms that are robust to frequent path disruptions caused by vehicles' mobility. This paper argues the use of information on vehicles' movement information (e.g., position, direction, speed, and digital mapping of roads) to predict a possible link-breakage event prior to its occurrence. Vehicles are grouped according to their velocity vectors. This kind of grouping ensures that vehicles, belonging to the same group, are more likely to establish stable single and multihop paths as they are moving together. Setting up routes that involve only vehicles from the same group guarantees a high level of stable communication in VANETs. The scheme presented in this paper also reduces the overall traffic in highly mobile VANET networks. The frequency of flood requests is reduced by elongating the link duration of the selected paths. To prevent broadcast storms that may be intrigued during path discovery operation, another scheme is also introduced. The basic concept behind the proposed scheme is to broadcast only specific and well-defined packets, referred to as ldquobest packetsrdquo in this paper. The performance of the scheme is evaluated through computer simulations. Simulation results indicate the benefits of the proposed routing strategy in terms of increasing link duration, reducing the number of link-breakage events and increasing the end-to-end throughput.",

The PRO routing algorithm can predict the variation of Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) and packet queue length (PQL) in the receiver. The prediction results are used to determine the utility of each relaying vehicle in the candidate set. The calculation of the vehicle utility is weight based algorithm and the weights are the variances of SINR and PQL of the candidate relaying vehicles. The relaying priority of each relaying vehicle is determined by the value of the utility. By these innovations, the PRO can achieve better routing performance (such as the packet delivery ratio, the end-to-end delay, and the network throughput) than the SRPE, ExOR (street-centric), and GPSR routing algorithms.",

      "abstract": "The increasing demand for advanced services in wireless networks raises the problem for quality of service (QoS) provisioning with proper resource management. In this research, such a provisioning technique for wireless networks is performed by Call Admission Control (CAC). A new approach in CAC named by Uniform Fractional Band (UFB) is proposed in this work for the wireless networks for providing proper priority between new calls and handover calls. This UFB scheme is basically a new style of handover priority scheme. Handover priority is provided by two stages in this scheme which help the network to utilize more resources. In addition, the handover call rate estimation and its impact on QoS provisioning is discussed widely to attain the optimum QoS in proposed handover priority scheme. In multiple services providing wireless network, excessive call blocking of lower priority traffic is very often event at very high traffic rate which is a concerning issue for QoS provisioning. To attain such QoS provisioning for multiple services, another CAC scheme is proposed in this research work. This scheme is recognized by Uniform Band Thinning (UBT) scheme which is based on uniform thinning technique (UTT) and this is quite similar idea as UFB scheme. In this scheme, a set of channels experiences the fractionizing policy. This scheme reduces the call blocking probabilities (CBP) of lower priority traffic classes without notably increasing the CBP of the higher priority traffic classes. The analytical functions of this scheme are deduced in general form which is useful to deduce for any number of traffic classes. In addition, numerical analysis of the proposed UBT scheme shows that the performances in terms of call blocking probability, overall call blocking probability, and channel utilization are improved and optimized compared to the conventional fixed guard channel scheme.",

Specifically, random arrival traffic is considered and an adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) scheme is adopted in the cooperative transmission system to improve the system performance. The average packet dropping rate of the relay-buffer is studied at first. With the packet dropping rate and stationary distribution of the system state, the closed-form expression of the delay is derived. Then the energy efficiency for relay-assisted transmission is investigated, which takes into account the queueing process of the relay and the source. In this context, an energy efficiency optimization problem is formulated to determine the optimum strategy of power and time allocation for the relay-assisted cooperative system. Finally, the energy efficient switching strategy between the relay assisted transmission and the direct transmission is obtained, where packet transmissions have different delay requirements. In addition, energy efficient transmission policy with AMC is obtained. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design improving the energy efficiency.",

      "abstract": "In wireless systems, transmitting large amounts of information with low energetic cost are two main issues that have never stopped drawing the attention of the scientific community during the past decade. Later, it has been shown that cooperative communication is an appealing technique that exploits spatial diversity in wireless channel. Therefore, this technique certainly promises a robust and reliable communications, higher quality-of-service (QoS) and makes the cooperation concept attractive for future cellular systems. Typically, the QoS requirements are the packet error rate, throughput and delay. These metrics are affected by the delay, where each erroneous packet is retransmitted several times according to Hybrid-Automatic Repeat-Request (HARQ) mechanism inducing a delay on the demanded QoS but a temporal diversity is created. Therefore, adopting jointly cooperative communications and HARQ mechanisms could be beneficial for designing cross-layer schemes. First, a new rate maximization strategy, under heterogeneous data rate constraints among users is proposed. We propose an algorithm that allocates the optimal power at the base station (BS) and relays, assigns subcarriers and selects relays. The achievable data rate is investigated as well as the average starvation rate in the network when the load, i.e. the number of active users in the network, is increasing. It showed a significant gain in terms of global capacity compared to literature. Second, in block fading channel, theoretical analyses of the packet error rate, delay and throughput efficiency in relayassisted HARQ networks are provided. In slow fading channels, the average delay of HARQ mechanisms w.r.t. the fading states is not relevant due to the non-ergodic process of the fading channel. The delay outage is hence invoked to deal with the slow fading channel and is defined as the probability that the average delay w.r.t. AWGN channel exceeds a predefined threshold. This criterion has never been studied in literature, although being of importance for delay sensitive applications in slow fading channels. Then, an analytical form of the delay outage probability is proposed which might be useful to avoid lengthy simulations. These analyses consider a finite packet length and a given modulation and coding scheme (MCS) which leads to study the performance of practical systems. Third, a theoretical analysis of the energy efficiency (bits/joule) in relay-assisted HARQ networks is provided. Based on this analysis, an energy minimization problem in multiuser relayassisted downlink cellular networks is investigated. Each user has an average delay constraint to be satisfied such that a total power constraint in the system is respected. The BS is assumed to have only knowledge about the average channel statistics but no instantaneous channel state information (CSI). Finally, an algorithm that jointly allocates the optimal power at BS, the relay stations and selects the optimal relay in order to satisfy the delay constrains of users is proposed. The simulations show the improvement in terms of energy consumption of relay-assisted techniques compared to nonaided transmission in delay-constrained systems. Hence, the work proposed in this thesis can give useful insights for engineering rules in the design of the next generation energyefficient cellular systems.",

      "abstract": "Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is one of the promising radio access techniques for performance enhancement in next-generation cellular communications. Compared to orthogonal frequency division multiple access, which is a well-known high-capacity orthogonal multiple access technique, NOMA offers a set of desirable benefits, including greater spectrum efficiency. There are different types of NOMA techniques, including power-domain and code-domain. This paper primarily focuses on power-domain NOMA that utilizes superposition coding at the transmitter and successive interference cancellation at the receiver. Various researchers have demonstrated that NOMA can be used effectively to meet both network-level and user-experienced data rate requirements of fifth-generation (5G) technologies. From that perspective, this paper comprehensively surveys the recent progress of NOMA in 5G systems, reviewing the state-of-the-art capacity analysis, power allocation strategies, user fairness, and user-pairing schemes in NOMA. In addition, this paper discusses how NOMA performs when it is integrated with various proven wireless communications techniques, such as cooperative communications, multiple-input multiple-output, beamforming, space\u2013time coding, and network coding among others. Furthermore, this paper discusses several important issues on NOMA implementation and provides some avenues for future research.",

We develop mathematical theorems which can serve as robust a posteriori error estimation techniques to identify numerical pollution, check the performance of adaptive meshes, and verify numerical solutions. We demonstrate performance of this methodology on problems from flow thorough porous media. However, one can extend it to other models. We construct mathematical properties such that the solutions to Darcy and Darcy-Brinkman equations satisfy them. The mathematical properties include the total minimum mechanical power, minimum dissipation theorem, reciprocal relation, and maximum principle for the vorticity. All the developed theorems have firm mechanical bases and are independent of numerical methods. So, these can be utilized for solution verification of finite element, finite volume, finite difference, lattice Boltzmann methods and so forth. In particular, we show that, for a given set of boundary conditions, Darcy velocity has the minimum total mechanical power of all the kinematically admissible vector fields. We also show that a similar result holds for Darcy-Brinkman velocity. We then show for a conservative body force, the Darcy and Darcy-Brinkman velocities have the minimum total dissipation among their respective kinematically admissible vector fields. Using numerical examples, we show that the minimum dissipation and total mechanical power theorems can be utilized to identify pollution errors in numerical solutions. The solutions to Darcy and Darcy-Brinkman equations are shown to satisfy a reciprocal relation, which has the potential to identify errors in the numerical implementation of boundary conditions.",

Small misalignment between the transmit and receive beams (e.g., due to the mobility) can result in a significant drop of the received signal quality, especially in line-of-sight communication channels. In this paper, we propose and evaluate high-resolution angle tracking strategies for wideband mmWave systems with mobility. We custom design pairs of auxiliary beams as the tracking beams, and use them to capture the angle variations, toward which the steering directions of the data beams are adjusted. Different from conventional beam tracking designs, the proposed framework neither depends on the angle variation model nor requires an on-grid assumption. For practical implementation of the proposed methods, we examine the impact of the array calibration errors on the auxiliary beam pair design. Numerical results reveal that by employing the proposed methods, good angle tracking performance can be achieved under various antenna array configurations, channel models, and mobility conditions.",

In this context, assuming that a sensor is responsible for executing some program task but unfortunately it's energy-level is lower than a pre-defined threshold. Then, this sensor should be able to introduce a query to the whole system in order to discover efficiently another sensor with the desired energy level, in which the task overhead must be eventually forwarded. In this way, the \"Life-Expectancy\" of the whole network could be increased. Sensor nodes are mapped to peers based on their energy level. As the energy levels change, the sensor nodes would have to move from one peer to another and this operation is very crucial for the efficient scalability of the proposed system. Similarly, as the energy level of a sensor node becomes extremely low, that node may want to forward it's task to another node with the desired energy level. The method presented in presents a novel P2P overlay for Energy Level discovery in a sensornet. However, this solution is not dynamic, since requires periodical restructuring. In particular, it is not able to support neither join of sensor_nodes with energy level out of the ranges supported by the existing p2p overlay nor leave of empty overlay_peers to which no sensor_nodes are currently associated. On this purpose and based on the efficient P2P method presented in [16], we design a dynamic P2P overlay for Energy Level discovery in a sensornet, the so-called SART (Sensors' Autonomous Range Tree). The adaptation of the P2P index presented in guarantees the best-known dynamic query performance of the above operation. We experimentally verify this performance, via the D-P2P-Sim simulator.",

Although a number of energy saving mechanisms have been proposed for the IEEE 802.16e, to minimize the power consumption of IEEE 802.16e mobile stations with multiple real-time connections has not yet been investigated. Moreover, they mainly consider non real- time connections in IEEE 802.16e networks. In this paper, we propose to design an adaptive power efficient packet scheduling algorithm that provides a minimum fair allocation of the channel bandwidth for each packet flow and additionally minimizes the power consumption. In the adaptive scheduling algorithm, packets are transmitted as per allotted slots from different priority of traffic classes adaptively, depending on the channel condition. Suppose if the buffer size of the high priority traffic queues with bad channel condition exceeds a threshold, then the priority of those flows will be increased by adjusting the sleep duty cycle of existing low priority traffic, to prevent the starvation.

      "abstract": "H-CRANs are envisioned to be promising in 5G wireless networks. H-CRANs enable users to enjoy diverse services with high energy efficiency, high spectral efficiency, and low-cost operation, which are achieved by using cloud computing and virtualization technologies. However, H-CRANs face many technical challenges due to massive user connectivity, increasingly severe spectrum scarcity, and high penetration of energy-constrained devices. These challenges may significantly degrade network performance and user quality of service if not properly tackled. NOMA schemes exploit non-orthogonal resource sharing among multiple users and have received tremendous attention due to their great potential to improve spectral and energy efficiency in 5G networks. This article focuses on the energy efficiency study in a NOMA enabled H-CRAN. Key 5G technologies that can be applied in NOMA H-CRANs to improve energy efficiency are presented. Challenges to implement these technologies and open research issues are discussed. The performance study shows that using NOMA enabled H-CRANs together with the key presented technologies can greatly improve overall system energy efficiency.",

This paper studies a new multiuser MEC system with multiantenna non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based computation offloading. In this system, multiple users simultaneously offload their computation tasks to one multi-antenna BS over the same time/frequency resources for remote execution, and the BS uses successive interference cancellation (SIC) for information decoding. We consider the partial offloading case, such that each user can partition the computation task into two parts for local computing and offloading, respectively. Under this setup, we minimize the weighted sum of the energy consumption at all users subject to their computation latency constraints. The decision variables include the task partition, local central processing unit (CPU) frequencies, and offloading power and rates at the users, and the SIC decoding order at the BS. We present an efficient algorithm to obtain the globally optimal solution to this problem by applying the Lagrange dual method. Numerical results show that the proposed NOMA-based partial offloading design can significantly improve the energy efficiency of the multiuser MEC system, as compared to benchmark schemes with orthogonal multiple access (OMA)-based partial offloading, and with only local computing or full offloading.",

We aim to minimize the weighted sum-energy consumption at all users subject to their computation latency constraints, by jointly optimizing the communication and computation resource allocation as well as the BS\u2019s decoding order for SIC. For the case with partial offloading, the weighted sum-energy minimization is a convex optimization problem, for which an efficient algorithm based on the Lagrange duality method is presented to obtain the globally optimal solution. For the case with binary offloading, the weighted sum-energy minimization corresponds to a mixed Boolean convex optimization problem that is generally more difficult to be solved. We first use the branch-and-bound (BnB) method to obtain the globally optimal solution and then develop two low-complexity algorithms based on the greedy method and the convex relaxation, respectively, to find suboptimal solutions with high quality in practice. Via numerical results, it is shown that the proposed NOMA-based computation offloading design significantly improves the energy efficiency of the multiuser MEC system as compared to other benchmark schemes.

To reduce the execution latency and device energy consumption, in this paper, we jointly optimize task offloading scheduling and transmit power allocation for MEC systems with multiple independent tasks. A low-complexity sub-optimal algorithm is proposed to minimize the weighted sum of the execution delay and device energy consumption based on alternating minimization. Specifically, given the transmit power allocation, the optimal task offloading scheduling, i.e., to determine the order of offloading, is obtained with the help of flow shop scheduling theory. Besides, the optimal transmit power allocation with a given task offloading scheduling decision will be determined using convex optimization techniques. Simulation results show that task offloading scheduling is more critical when the available radio and computational resources in MEC systems are relatively balanced.

These names are used when directly addressing users on Twitter, are part of their profile page URLs, and can become a trademark for popular accounts, with people referring to celebrities by their real name and their profile name, interchangeably. Twitter, however, has chosen to not permanently link profile names to their corresponding user accounts. In fact, Twitter allows users to change their profile name, and afterwards makes the old profile names available for other users to take. In this paper, we provide a large-scale study of the phenomenon of profile name reuse on Twitter. We show that this phenomenon is not uncommon, investigate the dynamics of profile name reuse, and characterize the accounts that are involved in it. We find that many of these accounts adopt abandoned profile names for questionable purposes, such as spreading malicious content, and using the profile name's popularity for search engine optimization. Finally, we show that this problem is not unique to Twitter (as other popular online social networks also release profile names) and argue that the risks involved with profile-name reuse outnumber the advantages provided by this feature.",

Such video sharing behavior greatly changes the interplays between the two types of websites. For example, users in OSNs may watch and re-share videos shared by their friends from online video websites, and this can also boost the popularity of videos in online video websites and attract more people to watch and share them. Characterizing these interplays can provide great insights for understanding the relationships among online video websites, OSNs, ISPs and so on. In this paper we conduct empirical experiments to study the interplays between video sharing websites and OSNs using three totally different data sources: online video websites, OSNs, and campus network traffic. We find that, a) there are many factors that can affect the external sharing probability of videos in online video websites. b) The popularity of a video itself in online video websites can greatly impact on its popularity in OSNs. Videos in Renren, Qzone (the top two most popular Chinese OSNs) usually attract more viewers than in Sina and Tencent Weibo (the top two most popular Chinese microblogs), which indicates the different natures of the two kinds of OSNs. c) The analysis based on real traffic data illustrates that 10\\% of video flows are related to OSNs, and they account for 25\\% of traffic generated by all videos.",

Channel pruning is usually applied to reduce the model redundancy while preserving the network structure, such that the pruned network can be easily deployed in practice. However, existing channel pruning methods require hand-crafted rules, which can result in a degraded model performance with respect to the tremendous potential pruning space given large neural networks. In this article, we introduce differentiable annealing indicator search (DAIS) that leverages the strength of neural architecture search in the channel pruning and automatically searches for the effective pruned model with given constraints on computation overhead. Specifically, DAIS relaxes the binarized channel indicators to be continuous and then jointly learns both indicators and model parameters via bi-level optimization. To bridge the non-negligible discrepancy between the continuous model and the target binarized model, DAIS proposes an annealing-based procedure to steer the indicator convergence toward binarized states. Moreover, DAIS designs various regularizations based on a priori structural knowledge to control the pruning sparsity and to improve model performance. Experimental results show that DAIS outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet.",

Converting convolutional layers into frequency domain significantly reduces the computation complexity of the sliding window operations in space domain.

To obtain high-throughput FPGA implementation, we propose spec - the first work to prune and accelerate spectral CNNs. First, we propose a systematic pruning algorithm based on Alternative Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). The offline pruning iteratively sets the majority of spectral weights to zero, without using any handcrafted heuristics. Then, we design an optimized pipeline architecture on FPGA that has efficient random access into the sparse kernels and exploits various dimensions of parallelism in convolutional layers. Overall, achieves high inference throughput with extremely low computation complexity and negligible accuracy degradation. We demonstrate by pruning and implementing LeNet and VGG16 on the Xilinx Virtex platform. After pruning 75% of the spectral weights, achieves 0% accuracy loss for LeNet, and <1% accuracy loss for VGG16.

We first study the EE maximization problem in the WPCN without any system throughput requirement. We show that the EE maximization problem for the WPCN can be cast into EE maximization problems for two simplified networks via exploiting its special structure. For each problem, we derive the optimal solution and provide the corresponding physical interpretation, despite the nonconvexity of the problems. Subsequently, we study the EE maximization problem under a minimum system throughput constraint. Exploiting fractional programming theory, we transform the resulting nonconvex problem into a standard convex optimization problem.

Unlike most previous works that only consider a static optimization framework with full traffic buffers, we formulate a dynamic optimization problem by explicitly considering the effects of random traffic arrivals and time-varying channel fading. The stochastic formulation can quantify the tradeoff between power consumption and queuing delay. Leveraging on the Lyapunov optimization technique, the stochastic optimization problem can be transformed into a per-slot penalized weighted sum rate maximization problem, which is shown to be nondeterministic polynomial-time hard. Based on the equivalence between the penalized weighted sum rate maximization problem and the penalized weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) problem, the group sparse beamforming optimization-based WMMSE algorithm and the relaxed integer programming-based WMMSE algorithm are proposed to efficiently obtain the joint RRH activation and beamforming policy. Both algorithms can converge to a stationary solution with low-complexity and can be implemented in a parallel manner, thus they are highly scalable to large-scale C-RANs.

      "abstract": "Efficient virtual machine (VM) management can dramatically reduce energy consumption in data centers. Existing VM management algorithms fall into two categories based on whether the VMs' resource demands are assumed to be static or dynamic. The former category fails to maximize the resource utilization as they cannot adapt to the dynamic nature of VMs' resource demands. Most approaches in the latter category are heuristical and lack theoretical performance guarantees. In this work, we formulate dynamic VM management as a large-scale Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem and derive an optimal solution. Our analysis of real-world data traces supports our choice of the modeling approach. However, solving the large-scale MDP problem suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Therefore, we further exploit the special structure of the problem and propose an approximate MDP-based dynamic VM management method, called MadVM. We prove the convergence of MadVM and analyze the bound of its approximation error. Moreover, MadVM can be implemented in a distributed system, which should suit the needs of real data centers. Extensive simulations based on two real-world workload traces show that MadVM achieves significant performance gains over two existing baseline approaches in power consumption, resource shortage and the number of VM migrations. Specifically, the more intensely the resource demands fluctuate, the more MadVM outperforms.",

We propose to use joint sparse signal recovery to solve the compressed sensing problem with structured dictionary mismatches and also give an analytical performance bound on this joint sparse recovery. We show that, under mild conditions, the reconstruction error of the original sparse signal is bounded by both the sparsity and the noise level in the measurement model. Moreover, we implement fast first-order algorithms to speed up the computing process. Numerical examples demonstrate the good performance of the proposed algorithm and also show that the joint-sparse recovery method yields a better reconstruction result than existing methods.

      "abstract": "This paper considers a downlink cloud radio access network (C-RAN) in which all the base-stations (BSs) are connected to a central computing cloud via digital backhaul links with finite capacities. Each user is associated with a user-centric cluster of BSs; the central processor shares the user's data with the BSs in the cluster, which then cooperatively serve the user through joint beamforming. Under this setup, this paper investigates the user scheduling, BS clustering, and beamforming design problem from a network utility maximization perspective. Differing from previous works, this paper explicitly considers the per-BS backhaul capacity constraints. We formulate the network utility maximization problem for the downlink C-RAN under two different models depending on whether the BS clustering for each user is dynamic or static over different user scheduling time slots. In the former case, the user-centric BS cluster is dynamically optimized for each scheduled user along with the beamforming vector in each time-frequency slot, whereas in the latter case, the user-centric BS cluster is fixed for each user and we jointly optimize the user scheduling and the beamforming vector to account for the backhaul constraints. In both cases, the nonconvex per-BS backhaul constraints are approximated using the reweighted \u21131-norm technique. This approximation allows us to reformulate the per-BS backhaul constraints into weighted per-BS power constraints and solve the weighted sum rate maximization problem through a generalized weighted minimum mean square error approach. This paper shows that the proposed dynamic clustering algorithm can achieve significant performance gain over existing naive clustering schemes. This paper also proposes two heuristic static clustering schemes that can already achieve a substantial portion of the gain.",

By leveraging the Lagrangian duality theory, we obtain closed-form solutions at each iteration to reduce the computational complexity. The well-structured solutions provide opportunities to apply the large-dimensional random matrix theory to derive deterministic approximations for the RRH ordering criterion. Such an approach helps to guide the RRH selection only based on the statistical channel state information, which does not require frequent update, thereby significantly reducing the computation overhead.

Multi-tier has become a major trend in the design of new generations of mobile networks such as advanced long term evolution (LTE-A) networks in order to support the high capacity demand required for multiservice traffic in wireless networks. Picocell emerged as one of the key radio access techniques for LTE-A networks to increase the LTE-Advanced coverage and capacity requirements in a cost-efficient way. Two-tier networks, comprising a LTE Macro-cellular network overlaid with shorter range and low power Picocells offer an economically important approach to improve the LTE-A network capacity. In this type of network an efficient call admission control scheme is required to improve the connection level Quality of Service (QoS) of the wireless networks in terms of dropping probability, blocking probability and resources utilization. This paper proposes a two-tier call admission control scheme for integrated LTE-A/Picocells to efficiently utilized the available resources and improve the network coverage. We compare and evaluate the proposed CAC in single and two-tier LTE-A networks.

We consider a single-cell IEEE 802.16 environment in which the base station allocates subchannels to the subscriber stations in its coverage area. The subchannels allocated to a subscriber station are shared by multiple connections at that subscriber station. To ensure the Quality of Service (QoS) performances, a Connection Admission Control (CAC) scheme is considered at a subscriber station. A queueing analytical framework for these admission control schemes is presented considering OFDMA-based transmission at the physical layer. Then, based on the queueing model, both the connection-level and the packet-level performances are studied and compared with their analogues in the case without CAC. The connection arrival is modeled by a Poisson process and the packet arrival for a connection by a two-state Markov Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP).

Many online planning algorithms rely on statistical sampling to avoid searching the whole state space, while still being able to make acceptable decisions. However, planning often has to be performed under strict computational constraints making online planning in multi-agent systems highly limited, which could lead to poor system performance, especially in stochastic domains. In this paper, we propose Emergent Value function Approximation for Distributed Environments (EVADE), an approach to integrate global experience into multi-agent online planning in stochastic domains to consider global effects during local planning. For this purpose, a value function is approximated online based on the emergent system behaviour by using methods of reinforcement learning. We empirically evaluated EVADE with two statistical multi-agent online planning algorithms in a highly complex and stochastic smart factory environment, where multiple agents need to process various items at a shared set of machines. Our experiments show that EVADE can effectively improve the performance of multi-agent online planning while offering efficiency w.r.t. the breadth and depth of the planning process.",

      "abstract": "Generalized Benders decomposition (GBD) is a globally optimal algorithm for mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems, which are NP-hard and can be widely found in the area of wireless resource allocation. The main idea of GBD is decomposing an MINLP problem into a primal problem and a master problem, which are iteratively solved until their solutions converge. However, a direct implementation of GBD is time- and memory-consuming. The main bottleneck is the high complexity of the master problem, which increases over the iterations. Therefore, we propose to leverage machine learning (ML) techniques to accelerate GBD aiming at decreasing the complexity of the master problem. Specifically, we utilize two different ML techniques, classification and regression, to deal with this acceleration task. In this way, a cut classifier and a cut regressor are learned, respectively, to distinguish between useful and useless cuts. Only useful cuts are added to the master problem and thus the complexity of the master problem is reduced. By using a resource allocation problem in device-to-device communication networks as an example, we validate that the proposed method can reduce the computational complexity of GBD without loss of optimality and has good generalization ability. The proposed method is applicable for solving various MINLP problems in wireless networks since the designs are invariant for different problems.",

      "abstract": "To reap the benefits of the Internet of Things (IoT), it is imperative to secure the system against cyber attacks in order to enable mission critical and real-time applications. To this end, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been widely used to detect anomalies caused by a cyber attacker in IoT systems. However, due to the large-scale nature of the IoT, its IDS must operate in a distributed manner with minimum dependence on a central controller. Moreover, in many scenarios such as health and financial applications, the IoT application datasets are private and IoT devices (IoTDs) may not intend to share such data. To this end, in this paper, a distributed generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed to provide a fully distributed IDS for the IoT so as to detect anomalous behavior without reliance on any centralized controller. In this architecture, every IoTD can monitor its own data as well as neighboring IoTDs to detect internal and external attacks. In addition, the proposed distributed IDS does not require any sharing of datasets among the IoTDs and, thus, it can be implemented in IoT applications that must preserve the privacy of user data such as health monitoring or financial applications. It is shown analytically that the proposed distributed GAN has higher accuracy of detecting intrusion compared to a standalone IDS that has access to only a single IoTD dataset. Simulation results show that the proposed distributed GAN-based IDS has up to 20% higher accuracy, 25% higher precision, and 60% lower false positive rate compared to a standalone GAN-based IDS.",

The former task is to extract aspects of a product or service from an opinion document, and the latter is to identify the polarity expressed in the document about these extracted aspects. Most existing algorithms address them as two separate tasks and solve them one by one, or only perform one task, which can be complicated for real applications. In this paper, we treat these two tasks as two sequence labeling problems and propose a novel Dual crOss-sharEd RNN framework (DOER) to generate all aspect term-polarity pairs of the input sentence simultaneously. Specifically, DOER involves a dual recurrent neural network to extract the respective representation of each task, and a cross-shared unit to consider the relationship between them. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on three benchmark datasets.",

At each time slot, the full-duplex relay station (RS) can fetch a network-coded packet from the macro base station (BS), and schedule a previously received packet for broadcasting to the users over time-varying channels. Our goal is to maximize the broadcast throughput. Since the associated Markov decision programming problem turns out to be intractable as the size of the problem increases, we propose a CAS scheme which is simple to implement and also achieves near-optimal performance. We provide a closed-form expression of the throughput of our scheme when the BS-to-RS channel is perfect, and prove that our scheme is optimal for one-user systems. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that our scheme performs close to an upper bound of the system and outperforms other transmission schemes.",

      "abstract": "The increasing interest in Peer-to-Peer systems (such as Gnutella) has inspired many research activities in this area. Although many demonstrations have been performed that show that the performance of a Peer-to-Peer system is highly dependent on the underlying network characteristics, much of the evaluation of Peer-to-Peer proposals has used simplified models that fail to include a detailed model of the underlying network. This can be largely attributed to the complexity in experimenting with a scalable Peer-to-Peer system simulator built on top of a scalable network simulator. A major problem of unstructured P2P systems is their heavy network traffic. In Peer-to-Peer context, a challenging problem is how to find the appropriate peer to deal with a given query without overly consuming bandwidth? Different methods proposed routing strategies of queries taking into account the P2P network at hand. This paper considers an unstructured P2P system based on an organization of peers around Super-Peers that are connected to Super-SuperPeer according to their semantic domains; in addition to integrating Decision Trees in P2P architectures to produce Query-Suitable Super-Peers, representing a community of peers where one among them is able to answer the given query. By analyzing the queries log file, a predictive model that avoids flooding queries in the P2P network is constructed after predicting the appropriate Super-Peer, and hence the peer to answer the query. A challenging problem in a schema-based Peer-to-Peer (P2P) system is how to locate peers that are relevant to a given query. In this paper, architecture, based on (Super-)Peers is proposed, focusing on query routing. The approach to be implemented, groups together (Super-)Peers that have similar interests for an efficient query routing method. In such groups, called Super-Super-Peers (SSP), Super-Peers submit queries that are often processed by members of this group. A SSP is a specific Super-Peer which contains knowledge about: 1. its Super-Peers and 2. The other SSP. Knowledge is extracted by using data mining techniques (e.g. Decision Tree algorithms) starting from queries of peers that transit on the network. The advantage of this distributed knowledge is that, it avoids making semantic mapping between heterogeneous data sources owned by (Super-)Peers, each time the system decides to route query to other (Super-) Peers. The set of SSP improves the robustness in queries routing mechanism, and the scalability in P2P Network. Compared with a baseline approach,the proposal architecture shows the effect of the data mining with better performance in respect to response time and precision.",

However, to realize the future real-time and delay-sensitive applications, F-RAN tailored radio resource allocation and interference management become necessary. This work investigates user association and beamforming issues for providing energy efficient F-RANs. We formulate the energy efficiency maximization problem, where the F-RAN specific constraint to guarantee local edge processing is explicitly considered. To solve this intricate problem, we design an algorithm based on the Augmented Lagrangian (AL) method. Then, to alleviate the computational complexity, a heuristic low-complexity strategy is developed, where the tasks are split in two parts: one solving for user association and Fog Access Points (F-AP) activation in a centralized manner at the cloud, based on global but outdated user Channel State Information (CSI) to account for fronthaul delays, and the second solving for beamforming in a distributed manner at each active F-AP based on perfect but local CSIs. Simulation results show that the proposed heuristic method achieves an appreciable performance level as compared to the AL-based method, while largely outperforming the energy efficiency of the baseline F-RAN scheme and limiting the sum-rate degradation compared to the optimized sum-rate maximization algorithm.11Part of this article has been presented at IEEE CCNC 2019 [1].",

      "abstract": "Effective resource allocation plays a pivotal role for performance optimization in wireless networks. Unfortunately, typical resource allocation problems are mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems, which are NP-hard in general. Machine learning-based methods recently emerge as a disruptive way to obtain near-optimal performance for MINLP problems with affordable computational complexity. However, a key challenge is that these methods require huge amounts of training samples, which are difficult to obtain in practice. Furthermore, they suffer from severe performance deterioration when the network parameters change, which commonly happens and can be characterized as the task mismatch issue. In this paper, to address the sample complexity issue, instead of directly learning the input-output mapping of a particular resource allocation algorithm, we propose a Learning to Optimize framework for Resource Allocation, called LORA, that learns the pruning policy in the optimal branchand-bound algorithm. By exploiting the algorithm structure, this framework enjoys an extremely low sample complexity, in the order of hundreds, compared with millions for existing methods. To further address the task mismatch issue, we propose a transfer learning method via self-imitation, named LORATL, which can adapt to the new task with only a few additional unlabeled training samples. Numerical simulations demonstrate that LORA outperforms specialized state-of-art algorithms and achieves nearoptimal performance. Moreover, LORA-TL, relying on a few unlabeled samples, achieves comparable performance with the model trained from scratch with sufficient labeled samples.

      "abstract": "Nowadays, enterprises widely deploy Network Functions (NFs) and server applications in the cloud. However, processing of sensitive data and trusted execution cannot be securely deployed in the untrusted cloud. Cloud providers themselves could accidentally leak private information (e.g., due to misconfigurations) or rogue users could exploit vulnerabilities of the providers' systems to compromise execution integrity, posing a threat to the confidentiality of internal enterprise and customer data. In this paper, we identify (i) a number of NF and server application use-cases that trusted execution can be applied to, (ii) the assets and impact of compromising the private data and execution integrity of each use-case, and (iii) we leverage Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX) architecture to design Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) for cloud-based NFs and server applications. We combine SGX with the Data Plane Development KIT (DPDK) to prototype and evaluate our TEEs for a number of application scenarios (Layer 2 frame and Layer 3 packet processing for plain and encrypted traffic, traffic load-balancing and back-end server processing). Our results indicate that NFs involving plain traffic can achieve almost native performance (e.g., ~22 Million Packets Per Second for Layer 3 forwarding for 64-byte frames), while NFs involving encrypted traffic and server processing can still achieve competitive performance (e.g., ~12 Million Packets Per Second for server processing for 64-byte frames).",

For example, these data can be related to pollution and gas emissions, which can be used to check the compliance with national and international regulations. The current approach for IoT data trading relies on a centralized third-party entity to negotiate between data consumers and data providers, which is inefficient and insecure on a large scale. In comparison, a decentralized approach based on distributed ledger technologies (DLT) enables data trading while ensuring trust, security, and privacy. However, due to the lack of understanding of the communication efficiency between sellers and buyers, there is still a significant gap in benchmarking the data trading protocols in IoT environments. Motivated by this knowledge gap, we introduce a model for DLT-based IoT data trading over the narrowband Internet-of-Things (NB-IoT) system, intended to support massive environmental sensing. We characterize the communication efficiency of three basic DLT-based IoT data trading protocols via NB-IoT connectivity in terms of latency and energy consumption. The model and analyses of these protocols provide a benchmark for IoT data trading applications.",

      "abstract": "Device\u2010to\u2010device (D2D) communication is a viable solution proposed by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) to handle the enormous number of devices and expected data explosion in 5G. It is competent in enhancing the system performances such as increased data rate, reduced delay, and less power consumption while maintaining a low load on the base station (BS). In this paper, channel assignment and power control scheme is proposed for underlay D2D system where one cellular channel is allowed to be shared among multiple D2D pairs. This will lead to enhanced spectral efficiency on the cost of additional interferences introduced among the D2D and cellular users (CUs). Our aim is to maximize the D2D throughput without degrading the performance of existing CU that is sharing the channel with D2D. This is achieved by maintaining a threshold signal\u2010to\u2010interference\u2010plus\u2010noise ratio (SINR) for each CU. A centralized channel assignment algorithm based on the well\u2010known two\u2010sided preference Gale\u2010Shapley algorithm is proposed, named as RAbaGS\u2010HR. Further, suboptimal distributed power control (DPC) algorithms are proposed for both uplink and downlink D2D. The novelty of the work lies in the facts that a channel is shared among multiple D2D users and the optimal power is calculated for all the users sharing the same channel under the full consideration of all kinds of interferences unlike most of the existing work that either assumed the fixed CU power or ignored the interferences among the D2D users. Numerical results show the efficacy of the proposed algorithms in terms of significant gain in throughput with a very low computational cost. In addition to this, the energy efficiency (EE) is also analyzed for different D2D user density, with respect to average circuit power consumption and D2D maximum transmit power.",

      "abstract": "Device-to-device (D2D) communication underlay cellular networks is a promising technique to improve spectrum efficiency. In this situation, D2D transmission may cause severe interference to both the cellular and other D2D links, which imposes a great technical challenge to spectrum allocation. Existing centralized schemes require global information, which causes a large signaling overhead. While existing distributed schemes requires frequent information exchange among D2D users and cannot achieve global optimization. In this paper, a distributed spectrum allocation framework based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning is proposed, named multi-agent actor critic (MAAC). MAAC shares global historical states, actions and policies during centralized training, requires no signal interaction during execution and utilizes cooperation among users to further optimize system performance. Moreover, in order to decrease the computing complexity of the training, we further propose the neighbor-agent actor critic (NAAC) based on the neighbor users\u2019 historical information for centralized training. The simulation results show that the proposed MAAC and NAAC can effectively reduce the outage probability of cellular links, greatly improve the sum rate of D2D links and converge quickly.",

Recent key applications include channel estimation and device activity detection in MIMO-based grant-free random access which is proposed to support massive machine-type communications (mMTC) for Internet of Things (IoT). Utilizing techniques in compressive sensing, optimization and deep learning, we propose two model-driven approaches, based on the standard auto-encoder structure for real numbers. One is to jointly design the common measurement matrix and jointly sparse signal recovery method, and the other aims to jointly design the common measurement matrix and jointly sparse support recovery method. The proposed model-driven approaches can effectively utilize features of sparsity patterns in designing common measurement matrices and adjusting model-driven decoders, and can greatly benefit from the underlying state-of-the-art recovery methods with theoretical guarantee. Hence, the obtained common measurement matrices and recovery methods can significantly outperform the underlying advanced recovery methods. We conduct extensive numerical results on channel estimation and device activity detection in MIMO-based grant-free random access. The numerical results show that the proposed approaches provide pilot sequences and channel estimation or device activity detection methods which can achieve higher estimation or detection accuracy with shorter computation time than existing ones. Furthermore, the numerical results explain how such gains are achieved via the proposed approaches.",

      "abstract": "Conversational agents such as Cortana, Alexa and Siri are continuously working on increasing their capabilities by adding new domains. The support of a new domain includes the design and development of a number of NLU components for domain classification, intents classification and slots tagging (including named entity recognition). Each component only performs well when trained on a large amount of labeled data. Second, these components are deployed on limited-memory devices which requires some model compression. Third, for some domains such as the health domain, it is hard to find a single training data set that covers all the required slot types. To overcome these mentioned problems, we present a multi-task transformer-based neural architecture for slot tagging. We consider the training of a slot tagger using multiple data sets covering different slot types as a multi-task learning problem. The experimental results on the biomedical domain have shown that the proposed approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art systems for slot tagging on the different benchmark biomedical datasets in terms of (time and memory) efficiency and effectiveness. The output slot tagger can be used by the conversational agent to better identify entities in the input utterances.",

      "abstract": "Multiple datasets containing different types of features may be available for a given task. For instance, users' profiles can be used to group users for recommendation systems. In addition, a model can also use users' historical behaviors and credit history to group users. Each dataset contains different information and suffices for learning. A number of clustering algorithms on multiple datasets were proposed during the past few years. These algorithms assume that at least one dataset is complete. So far as we know, all the previous methods will not be applicable if there is no complete dataset available. However, in reality, there are many situations where no dataset is complete. As in building a recommendation system, some new users may not have profiles or historical behaviors, while some may not have credit history. Hence, no available dataset is complete. In order to solve this problem, we propose an approach called Collective Kernel Learning to infer hidden sample similarity from multiple incomplete datasets. The idea is to collectively completes the kernel matrices of incomplete datasets by optimizing the alignment of shared instances of the datasets. Furthermore, a clustering algorithm is proposed based on the kernel matrix. The experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The proposed clustering algorithm outperforms the comparison algorithms by as much as two times in normalized mutual information.",

In comparison to RF and acoustic counterparts, underwater optical wireless communication (UOWC) can provide a much higher transmission bandwidth and much higher data rate. Therefore, we focus, in this paper, on the UOWC that employs optical wave as the transmission carrier. In recent years, many potential applications of UOWC systems have been proposed for environmental monitoring, offshore exploration, disaster precaution, and military operations. However, UOWC systems also suffer from severe absorption and scattering introduced by underwater channels. In order to overcome these technical barriers, several new system design approaches, which are different from the conventional terrestrial free-space optical communication, have been explored in recent years. We provide a comprehensive and exhaustive survey of the state-of-the-art UOWC research in three aspects: 1) channel characterization; 2) modulation; and 3) coding techniques, together with the practical implementations of UOWC.",

By storing the first few seconds of popular video clips, a multimedia local server can shield the users from the delay, throughput, and loss properties of the path between the local server and the central server. The key idea of controlled multicast is used to allow clients to share a segment of a video stream even when the requests arrive at different times. This dynamic buffer allocation algorithm is simulated and its performance is evaluated based on the buffer utilization by multimedia servers and average buffer allocation for the most popular videos. Our simulation results shows efficient utilization of network bandwidth and reduced hard disk utilization hence resulting in increase in the number of requests being served.",

The goal of this paper is to maximize the system throughput by jointly optimizing the 3D UAV trajectory, communication scheduling, and UAV-AP/SN transmit power. We first consider a special case where the UAV-BS and UAV-AP trajectories are pre-determined. Although the resulting problem is an integer and non-convex optimization problem, a globally optimal solution is obtained by applying the polyblock outer approximation (POA) method based on the problem\u2019s hidden monotonic structure. Subsequently, for the general case considering the 3D UAV trajectory optimization, an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed to alternately optimize the divided sub-problems based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed design is able to achieve significant system throughput gain over the benchmarks. In addition, the SCA-based method can achieve nearly the same performance as the POA-based method with much lower computational complexity.",

      "abstract": "Coupled with the rise of Deep Learning, the wealth of data and enhanced computation capabilities of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) components enable effective Artificial Intelligence (AI) based models to be built. Beyond ground data sources, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) based service providers for data collection and AI model training, i.e., Drones-as-a-Service (DaaS), is becoming increasingly popular in recent years. However, the stringent regulations governing data privacy potentially impedes data sharing across independently owned UAVs. To this end, we propose the adoption of a Federated Learning (FL) based approach to enable privacy-preserving collaborative Machine Learning across a federation of independent DaaS providers for the development of IoV applications, e.g., for traffic prediction and car park occupancy management. Given the information asymmetry and incentive mismatches between the UAVs and model owners, we leverage on the self-revealing properties of a multi-dimensional contract to ensure truthful reporting of the UAV types, while accounting for the multiple sources of heterogeneity, e.g., in sensing, computation, and transmission costs. Then, we adopt the Gale-Shapley algorithm to match the lowest cost UAV to each subregion. The simulation results validate the incentive compatibility of our contract design, and shows the efficiency of our matching, thus guaranteeing profit maximization for the model owner amid information asymmetry.",

      "abstract": "Social media becomes the central way for people to obtain and utilise news, due to its rapidness and inexpensive value of data distribution. Though, such features of social media platforms also present it a root cause of fake news distribution, causing adverse consequences on both people and culture. Hence, detecting fake news has become a significant research interest for bringing feasible real time solutions to the problem. Most current techniques of fake news disclosure are supervised, that need large cost in terms of time and effort to make a certainly interpreted dataset. The proposed framework concentrates on the text-based detection of fake news items while considering that only limited number of labels are available. Graphs are functioned extensively under several purposes of real-world problems on the strength of their property to structure things easily. Deep neural networks are used to generate great results within tasks that utilizes graph classification. The Graph Convolution Network works as a deep learning paradigm which works on graphs. Our proposed framework deals with limited amount of labelled data; we go for a semi-supervised learning method. We come up with a semisupervised fake news detection technique based on GCN (Graph Convolutional Networks). The recommended architecture comprises of three basic components: collecting word embeddings from the news articles in datasets utilising GloVe, building similarity graph using Word Mover\u2019s Distance (WMD) and finally applying Graph Convolution Network (GCN) for binary classification of news articles in semi-supervised paradigm. The implemented technique is validated on three different datasets by varying the volume of labelled data achieving 95.27 % highest accuracy on Real or Fake dataset. Comparison with other contemporary techniques also reinforced the supremacy of the proposed framework.",

      "abstract": "One essential task in information extraction from the medical corpus is drug name recognition. Compared with text sources come from other domains, the medical text mining poses more challenges, for example, more unstructured text, the fast growing of new terms addition, a wide range of name variation for the same drug, the lack of labeled dataset sources and external knowledge, and the multiple token representations for a single drug name. Although many approaches have been proposed to overwhelm the task, some problems remained with poor F-score performance (less than 0.75). This paper presents a new treatment in data representation techniques to overcome some of those challenges. We propose three data representation techniques based on the characteristics of word distribution and word similarities as a result of word embedding training. The first technique is evaluated with the standard NN model, that is, MLP. The second technique involves two deep network classifiers, that is, DBN and SAE. The third technique represents the sentence as a sequence that is evaluated with a recurrent NN model, that is, LSTM. In extracting the drug name entities, the third technique gives the best F-score performance compared to the state of the art, with its average F-score being 0.8645.",

      "abstract": "Recent malicious attempts are intended to get financial benefits through a large pool of compromised hosts, which are called software robots or simply \"bots.\" A group of bots, referred to as a botnet, is remotely controllable by a server and can be used for sending spam mails, stealing personal information, and launching DDoS attacks. Growing popularity of botnets compels to find proper countermeasures but existing defense mechanisms hardly catch up with the speed of botnet technologies. In this paper, we propose a botnet detection mechanism by monitoring DNS traffic to detect botnets, which form a group activity in DNS queries simultaneously sent by distributed bots. A few works have been proposed based on particular DNS information generated by a botnet, but they are easily evaded by changing bot programs. Our anomaly-based botnet detection mechanism is more robust than the previous approaches so that the variants of bots can be detectable by looking at their group activities in DNS traffic. From the experiments on a campus network, it is shown that the proposed mechanism can detect botnets effectively while bots are connecting to their server or migrating to another server.",

      "abstract": "A botnet is a network of compromised machines (bots), under the control of an attacker. Many of these machines are infected without their owners' knowledge, and botnets are the driving force behind several misuses and criminal activities on the Internet (for example spam emails). Depending on its topology, a botnet can have zero or more command and control (C&C) servers, which are centralized machines controlled by the cybercriminal that issue commands and receive reports back from the co-opted bots. \nIn this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the command and control infrastructure of one of the world's largest proprietary spamming botnets between 2007 and 2012: Cutwail/Pushdo. We identify the key functionalities needed by a spamming botnet to operate effectively. We then develop a number of attacks against the command and control logic of Cutwail that target those functionalities, and make the spamming operations of the botnet less effective. This analysis was made possible by having access to the source code of the C&C software, as well as setting up our own Cutwail C&C server, and by implementing a clone of the Cutwail bot. With the help of this tool, we were able to enumerate the number of bots currently registered with the C&C server, impersonate an existing bot to report false information to the C&C server, and manipulate spamming statistics of an arbitrary bot stored in the C&C database. Furthermore, we were able to make the control server inaccessible by conducting a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. Our results may be used by law enforcement and practitioners to develop better techniques to mitigate and cripple other botnets, since many of findings are generic and are due to the workflow of C&C communication in general.",
